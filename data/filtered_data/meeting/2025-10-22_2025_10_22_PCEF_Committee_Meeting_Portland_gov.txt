Public Comment
As a reminder, committee meetings are open to the public and we welcome
public comment. Please review our public participation guidelines for Zoom
meetings in advance of the meeting.
Sign up to provide verbal public comment
Members of the public are encouraged to sign up to provide public
comment. Sign up closes at the start of the committee meeting.
For those who did not sign up via the online form and would still like to
offer public comment, you will be prompted by the facilitator during the
public comment portion to request to be added to the queue of
commenters. To do so, you have 2 options:
1. Message meeting hosts using the chat box function in Zoom.
2. Verbally notify meeting hosts when we unmute the phone lines.
Provide written public comment
You can also submit written or verbal comments at any time. You have 2
options to submit your comments:
1. Send an email to CleanEnergyFund@portlandoregon.gov
2. Call 503-823-7713 and state “Committee Public Comment” in your
message.
If we receive your written comment by 12 p.m. two business days before
the meeting, we will send them to the committee in advance. All comments
received after this will be provided to the committee at the next meeting.
How to request in-person meeting accommodations
PCEF will provide in-person meeting accommodations for members of the
public who request it. If you require an accommodation of coming to a City
of Portland building to watch in person — with the understanding that PCEF
Committee members will all participate virtually — please send an email
to cleanenergyfund@portlandoregon.gov with your request three days
prior to the meeting date.
