additional affordable housing units from this reallocation.

• Discussion
Members discussed challenges in evaluating programs given their recent start and
o
limited data.
Concerns raised about transparency and influence of city bureaucracy on program
o
direction, especially regarding Strategic Program 14 (office-to-residential conversions
and loan programs), including worries about possible loan forgiveness undermining
fund recycling. Potential pre-approval of loan program details by Prosper Portland
raised transparency and community input concerns.
Emphasis on maintaining community-centered priorities and clear evaluation processes
o
going forward.
V. Priority Population Language Update Preview
• Proposed revision to climate investment plan’s priority population definition to align with city
legal language, changing “historically under resourced” to “are under resourced” and adding
“may include” for inclusivity.
• Addition of a workforce-specific priority population definition focusing on groups
underrepresented or facing barriers in clean energy and climate-related jobs.
• Committee members stressed importance of maintaining historical context and clarity on
priority populations.
• Further refinement expected with city attorney input and alignment across the CIP and code
definitions.
VI. Additional Items
• Recruitment deadline extended to October 26; ongoing applicant review. Members were
