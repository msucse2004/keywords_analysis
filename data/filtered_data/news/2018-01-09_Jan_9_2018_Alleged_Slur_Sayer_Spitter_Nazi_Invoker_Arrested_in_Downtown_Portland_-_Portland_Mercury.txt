Alleged Slur Sayer, Spitter, Nazi Invoker
Arrested in Downtown Portland
DOUG BROWN
A white man is accused of yelling a racial slur at a Jason C. Huffman
security guard in downtown Portland before spitting Jason C. Huffman
on the security guard's boots and issuing a "Nazi hand
sign" at him.
Jason Huffman, 46, was arrested by Portland police officers last Wednesday
and was charged with harassment and intimidation in the second degree, a
charge that alleges Huffman committed the crime because of the victim's
race (the security guard's race isn't mentioned in court records).
The alleged victim is a Clean & Safe security guard who was working at a
building on Burnside, the affidavit for Huffman's arrest states.
The security guard told the cops "he knows Jason Huffman from the past
several weeks and that Mr. Huffman would politely greet him each day," the
affidavit says. "He said this day, Mr. Huffman appeared different and tried to
enter the cafeteria" where the alleged victim works, and called the security
guard a "n*****" and spat on his boots. "He said Mr. Huffman also directed a
'Nazi' hand sign at him."
Cops soon arrested Huffman a few blocks away. He was booked and
released that day. It's unclear when he's due back in court.
