With less than a month before the November election, opponents of a Portland ballot measure that would
establish a new tax on large retailers have raised a substantial sum.
If passed, the measure would levy a 1 percent tax on Portland sales by businesses with $1 billion or more
in annual sales and $500,000 in Portland sales. Tax revenue would pay for eco-friendly jobs training and
home energy upgrades. Its backers include more than 100 grassroots groups, which have raised more than
$240,000 for the yes campaign, mostly from nonprofits supporting communities of color.
The no campaign has to date reported $382,355, according to campaign finance records. Here are the
donors who’ve given $10,000 or more:
