Mercury Endorsements: Vote Jo Ann Hardesty
for Portland City Council
THE MERCURY ELECTION STRIKE FORCE
Jo Ann Hardesty, speaking truth to power. NATALIE BEHRING
Check out all of the Mercury's 2018 election endorsements! From the race for
Oregon governor to the fight for affordable housing, we've got you covered.
This November, voters will make Portland history. Twice. Not only will
Portlanders elect the city’s first Black woman to city council, but in doing
so, they’ll create Portland’s first majority-female council. The outcome of
the race to replace outgoing Commissioner Dan Saltzman is a monumental
step forward in a city long ruled by white dudes. But don’t let this seemingly
“win-win” election allow you to gloss over this vote. Candidates Jo Ann
Hardesty and Loretta Smith couldn’t be less alike in their politics.
Hardesty—a one-time state legislator, a former president of the NAACP’s
Portland branch, and a leader in Portland’s activist community—is an
outspoken advocate for police accountability, affordable housing, and
environmental justice. Smith, a two-term Multnomah County
Commissioner and former aide to Senator Ron Wyden, advocates for a
larger police force and job creation, and believes Portland’s wealthiest
developers will solve the city’s homelessness crisis.
Hardesty’s shown interest in expanding tenants’ rights, helping create a
stronger network of homeless villages like Right 2 Dream Too, and is one of
the architects of Portland Clean Energy Fund, a measure on the ballot that
would tax major corporations to fund renewable energy projects and jobs.
Smith has championed a successful program connecting minority youth to
summer jobs, but also wants to turn a former county jail into a mass
homeless shelter, despite concerns from longtime experts in housing and
homelessness.
We believe Portland needs a leader committed to shrinking the disparities
among the city’s growing population and willing to make political sacrifices
to hold Portland’s power brokers accountable.
Both women have fought criticism in their policy decisions and political
beliefs. Smith has taken many of these rebukes as personal attacks, and has
responded by gaslighting her opponents rather than pausing to consider
differing opinions and seeking compromise. Hardesty, meanwhile, has a
record of listening to critics and exploring the nuance of an argument. And
in every fight, she’s put the community she represents before her self image.
This is a critical difference.
Hardesty is running for Portland City Council to give a platform to the city’s
most underrepresented communities—families teetering on the edge of
homelessness, parents who’ve lost children to police violence, small
businesses struggling to stay open in gentrifying neighborhoods, young
adults spit out by the criminal justice system, and people of color
disproportionately impacted by climate change. She’s not running to propel
her career forward, but to move Portland toward a more equitable, united
future. We believe Portland needs a leader committed to shrinking the
disparities among the city’s growing population and willing to make
political sacrifices to hold Portland’s power brokers accountable. That’s why
we’re endorsing Jo Ann Hardesty for Portland City Commissioner, Position
3.
“I will always admit to what I’ve done wrong."
Hardesty is the voice of criminal justice and police reform currently missing
on city council. She has the experience: Hardesty was part of the group that
called on the US Department of Justice to investigate if officers in the
Portland Police Bureau (PPB) are more likely to use violence against people
of color and those with mental illnesses. Recently, Hardesty raised concerns
about a city audit that found PPB’s gang enforcement unit had been
disproportionately pulling over African American drivers. She’s particularly
opposed to police officers acting as responders to mental health crises, and
has proposed plans to hand that responsibility over to the Portland Fire
Bureau, “where their job is to save lives, not endanger them.” If elected,
that’s one of the bureaus she’ll oversee.
Hardesty’s not without flaws. An investigation by OPB found that while she
was NAACP president, Hardesty sidestepped procedure to pen a $10,000
check to her own consulting firm without board members’ approval or bids
from other consultants. She also did not report that income to the federal
government or pay taxes on it. She blames this on not knowing it needed to
be reported, but it’s not a good look for someone who’ll be responsible for
tens of thousands of city dollars.
In the Mercury endorsement interview, Hardesty was quick to take
responsibility and promised to surround herself with smart bureau
directors and budget experts to ensure she doesn’t make the same mistake.
“I will always admit to what I’ve done wrong,” Hardesty told us.
Shortly after OPB’s story broke in September, Smith issued a press release
announcing that Hardesty had embezzled money from the NAACP. Neither
her office nor any legal officials have offered proof to substantiate that
serious allegation. It’s only one example of Smith’s affinity for old-school
smear campaigns. In the Mercury’s interview, Smith hinted that Hardesty
may have been dishonorably discharged during her stint in the US Navy.
(Military records shared with the Mercury by Hardesty’s campaign show
Hardesty had been honorably discharged from active duty in 1979 before
continuing in the Navy Reserve until 1984.)
We can’t have someone [in city hall] prioritizing her own reputation over
what’s best for a community.
Sure, negative attacks are somewhat expected from a candidate who lost to
Hardesty by 25 percentage points in May’s primary election. But this
behavior isn’t just reserved for a cutthroat campaign: As county
commissioner, Smith was accused of making racially charged remarks
about Latinos and Muslims, criticizing a female employee for her weight,
and ordering staff to use personal time to attend her campaign events. A
2017 investigation into these allegations found them all to be true, and
unearthed new issues with how Smith had mismanaged her office’s
finances by spending up to $2,300 on personal expenses. Smith falsely told
the public that the report found all of these accusations to be
unsubstantiated.
An elected official who’s quick to drop baseless accusations about
opponents to improve her standing—while blindly ignoring substantiated
and substantial concerns about her own conduct—has no place in our
council chambers. We can’t have someone prioritizing her own reputation
over what’s best for a community.
Hardesty’s expertise, resilience, and community-focused policymaking
belongs in city hall. We’re excited to see what new ideas, conversations, and
policies she’ll bring to Portland’s stagnant city council.
