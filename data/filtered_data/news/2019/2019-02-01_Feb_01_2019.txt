Redevelopment of Portland’s Central Eastside transformed it from gritty
industrial district to thriving retail, dining and entertainment hub in recent
years.
But entrepreneurs there say increasing “crime and grime” have spurred them
to propose a multimillion-dollar effort to patrol Central Eastside streets,
remove graffiti, conduct extra garbage pickup and redirect homeless people
to social services.
Portland already has two similar programs, called enhanced service districts,
in the downtown core and the Lloyd District.
