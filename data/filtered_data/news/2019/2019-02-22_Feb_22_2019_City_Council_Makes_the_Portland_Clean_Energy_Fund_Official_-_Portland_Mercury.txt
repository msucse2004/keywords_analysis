City Council Makes the Portland Clean Energy
Fund Official

Last November, Portland voters passed a ballot measure to created
Portland Clean Energy Fund (PCEF). On Thursday, the Portland City
Council voted the fund into official city code.
The PCEF establishes a one percent business tax on companies that
annually make over a billion dollars nationally, and more than $500,000
locally. That money will be used for environmentally-friendly job creation
and sustainable building projects that will benefit low-income people and
people of color. It passed with 65 percent of the vote in last year’s election.
The measure was supported by a broad coalition of groups, including the
Portland chapter of the NAACP, the Sierra Club, Coalition of Communities
of Color, and others. As president of the Portland NAACP in the run-up to
the 2018 election, Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty championed the ballot
measure.
“What we did was something that I’ve never seen happen before in
Portland, and certainly not in Oregon,” Hardesty said at Thursday’s meeting,
noting the diverse base of support the PCEF has. “And quite frankly, I don’t
think we’ve seen it anywhere else.”
By passing two PCEF ordinances, the city council set the wheels in motion
to hire four Bureau of Planning and Sustainability (BPS) staffers to oversee
the fund, and to establish and nine-person PCEF grant committee.
According to Damon Motz-Storey, a spokesperson for the coalition behind
the PCEF, there aren’t any other programs like it that he knows of in the US
—ones that marry sustainability, corporate responsibility and equity like
the PCEF does—though it’s similar to a national Green New Deal sponsored
by Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
“We don’t really have any models to be basing our program off of, and that’s
kind of exciting,” he told the Mercury. “This is potentially going to be a
blueprint for other cities to adopt similar strategies. … That’s definitely on
the forefront of our minds right now.”
The PCEF grant committee will be responsible for allocating the funds,
which PCEF backers say will equal at least $30 million a year. It will include
nine Portland residents, at least two of whom will need to live east of 82nd
Ave to ensure geographic diversity. Applicants’ racial and socio-economic
backgrounds will also be considered.
Corporations have a grace period this year while the fund is established, but
Motz-Storey said they hope to open grant applications to organizations in
early 2020.
This year's plan for the PCEF? "Have conversations in the city with groups
that have never engaged in clean energy," says Motz-Storey, "and start
having conversations with people asking, 'What are ways that your
community could really benefit from this?'"
