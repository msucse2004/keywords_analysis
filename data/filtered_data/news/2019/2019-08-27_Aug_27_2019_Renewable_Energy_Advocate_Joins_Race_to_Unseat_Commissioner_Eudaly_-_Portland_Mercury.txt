Renewable Energy Advocate Joins Race to
Unseat Commissioner Eudaly

A retired right-wing renewable energy consultant has announced his plans
to run for Portland City Council in 2020.
Jack Kerfoot registered a campaign finance committee with the Secretary of
State's office on Friday, August 23. He plans on running for the council seat
currently occupied by Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, who is planning on
running for re-election.
Kerfoot worked in the oil and gas energy industry for 40 years, an
experience documented in his book Fueling America: An Insider's Journey.
Since retiring, Kerfoot has been invited to speak at different events as an
expert on renewables, most recently as part of a July City Club panel on the
New Green Deal.
In a August 23 Facebook post announcing his campaign, Kerfoot wrote
that, "Renewable energy will be a major component in my platform."
"Portland has committed to be 100% renewable by 2035 but has no viable
plan to reach this goal," he continued. Kerfoot has not returned the
Mercury's request for comment.
Kerfoot's social media presence shows his strong allegiance to Donald
Trump. On Twitter, Kerfoot has shared posts by Brietbart and other
questionable right-wing websites, applauding the border wall construction,
criticizing "obnoxious" female politicians, and spreading conspiracy
theories about "illegals."
Update 9/26:
After posting this blog, Kerfoot deleted his Twitter account and created a new
one. In an email to the Mercury, Kerfoot said he believed his Twitter account
was hacked and he didn't recall retweeting Brietbart. He said he doesn't
support Trump nor does he back his immigration policies.
As of today, the only donation in Kerfoot's campaign coffers is a $1,000
contribution from his own campaign. He joins two other candidates—
banker Kevin McKay and campaign finance advocate Seth Woolley—in the
race to unseat Eudaly.
