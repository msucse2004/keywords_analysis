People living in the new Tillamook Row housing complex in Northeast
Portland are expecting to pay nothing in energy bills. About a mile away in
the King neighborhood, a second, smaller home makes more renewable
energy than the occupants use.
Across Portland are newly built dwellings and older ones retrofitted to be so
environmentally smart -- with an airtight, super-insulated structure and
energy-efficient features such as carefully positioned solar panels -- that,
over the course of a year, they reward residents with zero energy bills and a
carbon-free home.
Want to learn more? You can wander through a dozen green Portland homes
from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 19, during the Goal Zero Tour.
