Mayor Wheeler Responds to Campaign Against
Homeless Camp Cleanups
ALEX ZIELINSKI
Homeless Portlanders and advocates kicked off a campaign yesterday that
calls on the city to halt its practice of routinely tearing down homeless
encampments.
“Camp sweeps are a problem in that they give the public the perception
that homeless people are all worthless,” said Jeff Liddicoat, a homeless
Portlander who spoke at an afternoon press conference outside of City Hall.
Liddicoat and others said the city’s cleanups—in which all personal
property is taken and temporarily stored in a city-run warehouse—only
exacerbate Portlanders’ inability to find stable housing.
“But, if we can reflect on basic values,” he said, “things have a chance of
changing. We have the ability to come together as a community and find
something akin to consensus.”
The campaign, called Stop the Sweeps PDX, asks city officials to attend a
series of public hearings where homeless people can share the negative
impact these cleanups have had on their lives. Supported by local homeless
organizations like Sisters of the Road, Street Roots, and Right 2 Survive, the
campaign also requests a moratorium on all camp cleanups in the City of
Portland.
Mayor Ted Wheeler responded to the group’s requests during a Friday press
conference.
“While it is illegal to erect tents in public right-of-ways, we do not randomly
go out and harass or remove people camping on the streets,” said Wheeler.
The City of Portland, which is alerted to encampments through an online
reporting system, is legally obligated to give campers a 48-hour heads up
before they clear a homeless camp. Since 2014, the city has relied on outside
contractors to carry out nearly 8,000 camp cleanups.
“The whole reason we have this contract is so that we are thoughtful and
compassionate about how we prioritize cleanups of camps,” Wheeler said.
“They are prioritized based on public safety, on environmental hazards, on
public health hazards.”
Wheeler said that in the new year, Portland City Council is expected to vote
to approve a new, more “compassionate” contract with a biohazard
company to continue orchestrating the city cleanups.
“I believe the city council will be impressed by the changes made,” he said,
stressing the importance of public engagement before the vote.
Yesterday, Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty told the Mercury that she doesn’t
support the proposed contract—as it puts too much responsibility on a
single company.
Wheeler acknowledged a December 16 decision by the US Supreme Court
to uphold a lower court’s ruling, which barred the City of Boise from
ticketing people camping in public spaces.
“It’s my understanding that that ruling very narrowly addresses issuing
citations for camping,” Wheeler said. “So, there is a question to what degree,
if any, [Portland] issues citations for camping.”
Wheeler says he won’t be sure how the ruling will impact Portland’s
cleanup process until the city attorney is through reviewing it.
At the Thursday campaign kick-off, homeless advocate Rachelle Dixon said
she’s seeing a “lack of will” from elected officials—especially those like
Wheeler, who are running for reelection in 2020—on repairing the trauma
brought by homeless camp sweeps.
“Promise me that you’ll do one thing,” said Dixon, who also serves as the
vice-chair of the Multnomah County Democrats. “Ask any and every elected
official, ‘How do [you] feel about sweeps?’ and 'What are [you] doing about
the housing problems?' And if they can’t give you a good, satisfactory
answer, let them know you will not be voting for them.”
