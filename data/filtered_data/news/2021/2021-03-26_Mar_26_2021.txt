Dozens of Portland nonprofits are poised to become the first recipients of a
massive, voter-approved program that seeks to bankroll clean energy
projects and jobs geared toward the city’s historically marginalized
communities.
The City Council next week will decide whether to approve 45 grant
proposals recommended by committee members of the Portland Clean
Energy Community Benefits Fund.
Those proposals include everything from energy retrofits for Black
homeowners to rooftop gardens run by a local yoga studio, documents
released Friday show.
