The March 26 article “Portland’s massive clean energy fund set to bankroll
first projects for communities of color, marginalized residents” raised grave
concerns about the future of the Clean Energy Fund. A review of the Clean
Energy Fund Committee’s report to the City Council reinforces, rather than
alleviates, those concerns.
The fund was sold to the voters largely as a way to address climate change.
But the committee’s project recommendations and analyses rarely say
anything about the measurable potential of a project to reduce carbon
emissions. The fund was also sold as a way to help historically disadvantaged
communities. But in most cases, the committee gives no indication of how
much help a project would likely give to how many people.
Putting a rooftop garden on top of a yoga studio has virtually nothing to do
with climate change. But the committee ranked the yoga studio higher than a
truly meaningful proposal to provide energy-efficient, ductless heat-pump
units to low-income and community of color populations. And the
committee rejected a proposal to train people from underrepresented
groups in electric vehicle repair – exactly the kind of proposal that addresses
both climate change and marginalized communities.
