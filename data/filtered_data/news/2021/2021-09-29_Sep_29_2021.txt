Portland city officials are preparing to bankroll a new bonanza of clean energy
projects and jobs geared toward the city’s historically marginalized
communities.
About $100 million will be up for grabs before the end of 2022 for local
nonprofit groups that can retrofit low-income homes, plant trees in sun-
scorched neighborhoods and perform other activities that reduce greenhouse
gas emissions or build green energy workforces.
The program, known as the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefit Fund,
began soliciting proposals Tuesday for a $60 million tranche to be awarded this
spring. It plans to dole out an additional $35 million to $45 million later in
2022, city officials said.
