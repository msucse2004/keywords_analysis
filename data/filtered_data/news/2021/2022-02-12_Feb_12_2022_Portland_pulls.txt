Portland city officials Friday said they plan to rescind a nearly $12 million
award to a local nonprofit following an investigation by The
Oregonian/OregonLive that documented its leader’s extensive history of
financial misdeeds and unpaid taxes.
The Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund had tapped the group
Diversifying Energy to head an ambitious city initiative: purchase, deliver and
install portable cooling units inside thousands of homes and apartments whose
low-income residents are most at risk during deadly heat waves like that one
that killed more than 60 people in Multnomah County earlier this year.
The decision, issued by the fund’s grants committee and unanimously
approved by the City Council this month, was made despite concerns from
city staffers about the nonprofit’s high personnel costs and proposed
timeline to deliver. Staff had recommended the sole rival bidder.
