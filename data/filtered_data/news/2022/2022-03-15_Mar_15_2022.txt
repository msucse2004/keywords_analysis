The head of the Portland agency tasked with tackling climate change and
managing a massive clean energy program that’s both awash in cash and under
scrutiny has accepted a six-figure severance to depart the agency.
Andrea Durbin, the director of the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability,
announced her pending departure Tuesday in a joint statement with
Commissioner Carmen Rubio, who assumed control of the department last year.
“As we emerge from the pandemic, it is time for me to focus on my family and
being more present for my daughter during her last two years before she leaves
for college,” Durbin said in a news release. “If we’ve learned anything from the
pandemic, it is that life is too short. I’ve decided it is time to prioritize my
family.”
