Judge Hears Arguments Against Legality of
Proposed City Charter Amendments

A Multnomah County judge heard arguments Thursday on why a proposed
ballot measure to amend Portland’s city charter may be unconstitutional.
“Political expediency does not override voting rights,” said attorney Steve
Elzinga, representing the Portland Business Alliance (PBA), one of the
groups challenging the ballot measure.
The decision addresses a ballot measure proposed by Portland’s charter
commission, a 20-person volunteer group tasked with reviewing and
suggesting improvements to the city charter. The proposed measure
combines three proposals: If passed, it would divide the city into districts
represented by 12 elected officials, add a city manager to oversee the city’s
day-to-day operations, and introduce ranked-choice voting for all city
elections.
Two different groups have challenged this proposal, both concerned that
bundling all issues into one ballot measure could confuse voters and lessen
the chances of the measure’s passage. In July, the PBA sued the city’s
elections office, arguing that the ballot measure is unconstitutional because
it violates a legal requirement for ballot measures to only address one
subject. A day later, Portlander James Posey filed another lawsuit, claiming
that the required 10-word caption and 20-word question that describes the
ballot measure to voters does not accurately represent the proposed
changes.
Both PBA and Posey argue that ranked-choice voting is too complicated for
voters to understand, equating it to a form of voter suppression.
The city was hit with one more complaint around the same time, this time
coming from a group that supports the proposed ballot measure. Filed by
members of the voting rights nonprofit NextUp, the lawsuit also argued
that the ballot title and description was too unclear for potential voters to
understand.
On Thursday, Circuit Court Judge Stephen Bushong heard legal arguments
in all three challenges.
“Each ballot measure can stand on its own merits,” said Elzinga, arguing
that the proposed amendments should exist as standalone ballot measures.
“[The] proposed ballot measure here is so broad it violates voter
protections.”
City attorney Maja Haium pointed to the city’s history in her rebuttal. She
explained that when Portland formed its current “commission” form of
government, it was approved in a single ballot measure that combined a
variety of reforms—including the elimination of city districts and
downsizing of City Council seats. Like now, the proposal was challenged,
and ended up before the Oregon Supreme Court.
“In 1913, the Supreme Court ruled that it was necessary to vote on the
reforms as one package, because separate votes might destroy the efficacy
of the reforms to city government,” said Haium. “This is no different.”
She likened the ballot measure to a three-legged stool that requires all
measures to pass to operate.
“If one or two measures are not approved, the one or two legs remaining
makes for an ineffective stool,” Haium said.
She also argued that the state constitutional requirement that ballot
measures focus on a single subject is solely reserved for initiative petitions
—or, proposals introduced by citizens who gather enough signatures to
qualify for the ballot. The requirement does not apply for measures referred
to a ballot from a charter commission, Haium contended.
Posey, who represented himself in the hearing, argued that the ballot title
and question provided for the proposed measure was a disservice to
Portland voters. He expressed particular concern that the title does not
mention the intent to adapt the city’s voting system to ranked-choice, a
voting style that the city has never used.
“Voters deserve to know how this new method of voting will be
determined, to make an educated decision,” he said.
The ballot title and question is, combined, confined to 30 words. In her
response on behalf of NextUp, attorney Margaret Olney rejected this
argument, contending that the complaints about the process being too
complicated were overblown and that ranked-choice should be seen as a
boon for voter’s rights.
“Instead of holding their nose and picking one candidate, voters can
express their preferences by ranking candidates in order,” said Olney. She
did agree that the phrasing of the ballot’s question was confusing and
suggested a summary of the ballot measure in the voter’s pamphlet would
provide more information on ranked-choice.
Bushong appeared sympathetic to the overall cloudiness of the measure’s
title, noting that as a voter himself, he doesn’t completely understand
ranked-choice voting. Bushong said he will rule on all challenges to the
measure no later than the end of Monday.
