Climate Advocates Eye Opportunity to Restrict
Fossil Fuels in Portland Charter

Eager to see progress on Portland’s climate goals, environmental advocates
are urging Portland’s Charter Review Commission to propose a charter
amendment that would oppose the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure in
the city. Advocates believe the ongoing charter review process is an
opportunity to strengthen Portland’s commitment to reducing its carbon
footprint and advance its climate goals.
“This is not a radical shift, and it's not banning all fossil fuel use tomorrow,
but rather something that we've been calling for as scientists and activists
for quite a long time,” said Ben Stevenson, a member of environmental
group Sunrise PDX . “If we’re going to address climate change, this is
something we need to have.”
Every 10 years, a group of 20 volunteers selected by Portland City Council
members are tasked with reviewing the city charter and suggesting
amendments. The latest charter commission, which convened in 2020, is
halfway through its current review—its first proposed package of charter
amendments to alter the city’s form of government passed in last week’s
general election.
The charter commission is now in the second phase of the process,
reviewing the charter with a new focus on environmental justice, voting
rights, and amendments proposed by city bureaus. The commission has
until early December to decide what proposed charter amendments, if any,
should go before voters in the May or November 2024 election. A majority
of the commission can also vote to recommend the proposed amendments
to city council, which would then determine what amendments should go
to voters during an election of their choosing.
Environmental advocates see this second phase of work as an opportunity
to advance Portland’s climate goals by editing the charter to mandate the
city to restrict the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and actively phase
out the use of fossil fuels overall. Portland has committed to reducing its
emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero
carbon emissions by 2050. The city must make significant and dramatic
changes in the next eight years to achieve those goals.
“We’ve got really great language that is the current policy of the city, but it’s
not binding,” said Bryan Lewis, a member of the Charter Review
Commission’s climate subcommittee, in an October commission meeting.
“It doesn’t bind the bureaus, it doesn’t bind city council, it doesn’t bind
anybody. They are having difficulty—as hard as they are striving, as hard as
they are working—to reach our climate goals.”
Earlier this year, Portland officials banned new fossil fuel infrastructure in
the city for the third time after previous attempts were challenged in court
by the fossil fuel industry and the Portland Business Alliance for six years.
While courts sided in the city’s favor, they also determined the city needed
to provide additional evidence to prove it had the authority to block the
expansion of fossil fuels based on existing city code. A similar legal
determination was made in the city's favor when oil transporter Zenith
Energy challenged Portland’s denial of a land use permit in 2021; that case
ended with a compromise allowing Zenith to continue operating as long as
they switch to transporting renewable fuels in the next five years.
Specific language restricting fossil fuels in Portland’s charter could be what
the city needs to defend its attempts to limit the city’s emissions and reduce
the region’s reliance on fossil fuels.
The charter commission is currently proposing an amendment that will
require the city to “actively manage the decline of fossil fuel use within its
boundaries, consistent with environmental justice, public health, seismic
resiliency, and the best available science,” along with a commitment to add
environmental justice as a “core city value” (Read the full amendment text
here, under Proposal #12).
Climate advocates are pushing for a stronger amendment that would
require the city to “prevent expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure” and
“actively undertake the decline to net zero” fossil fuel usage in the city. The
proposed amendment language would also explicitly permit infrastructure
that would help the city transition to 100 percent renewable electricity.
Stevenson with Sunrise PDX said that this language is pulled from previous
or existing ordinances and city policies. By baking Portland’s existing
climate efforts and values into the city charter, the city could have a
stronger foundation to fight legal challengers and a binding commitment to
act on climate change, Stevenson argued.
“This is not a new idea,” Stevenson said. “Having something that prevents
[the expansion of] fossil fuel infrastructure and phasing out fossil fuels in
the charter would coalesce to have a binding commitment that would lead
to some stronger action.”
According to Indi Namkoong of environmental group 350PDX, a lot of city
and climate activist energy in Portland goes toward preventing the city
from “backsliding.” For example, several environmental organizations are
calling for the city to rescind its deal with Zenith that allows the oil
transporter to continue operating in the city as long as it switches to
renewable fuels within five years, arguing that the oil transporter cannot be
trusted to operate in Portland due to a history of misleading city officials
about its operations. Activists have called for the city to put more of its
budget toward climate change mitigation efforts in alignment with its
stated goals—Mayor Ted Wheeler dedicated $2.4 million to explicit climate
change mitigation efforts in the most recent budget cycle, less than one
percent of the total budget.
“We don't want [the city] to have to keep going back to the drawing board,”
Namkoong said. “This is an opportunity to make sure the work isn’t
subverted the second that it passes through [city council] and align the city
government’s efforts with the community and scientists.”
When introducing the latest climate emergency work plan to city council in
August, Bureau of Planning and Sustainability (BPS) director Donnie
Oliveira urged city council to act decisively on the plan.
“The low hanging fruit is gone,” Oliveira told city council in August. “The
next policy decisions and initiatives we take as a city are not going to be
easy.”
BPS and Oliveira have indicated general support for committing the city to
reducing its reliance on fossil fuels through a charter amendment.
“We are supportive of any effort to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” BPS
spokesperson Magan Reed told the Mercury.
During an October meeting on climate related charter amendments, the
charter review commission members said that while they are currently
moving forward with amendment language that does not restrict the
expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, they want to hear community
feedback on whether stricter language should be used in the amendment.
The charter commission is holding public input sessions on November 17
and November 19 to solicit feedback on all of the 14 proposed charter
amendments.
