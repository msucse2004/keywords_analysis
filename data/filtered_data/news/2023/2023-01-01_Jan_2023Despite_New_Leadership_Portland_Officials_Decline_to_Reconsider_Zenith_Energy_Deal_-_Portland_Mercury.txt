Despite New Leadership, Portland
Officials Decline to Reconsider Zenith
Energy Deal
Climate activists will now turn their attention to the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality.

When Mayor Ted Wheeler reassigned the Bureau of Development Services
(BDS) to Commissioner Carmen Rubio at the beginning of the month,
climate activists in Portland had cause for hope.
The city commissioner in charge of BDS is responsible for the city’s decision
about whether to grant a land use permit to the oil transport company
Zenith Energy to continue operating its oil transportation facility in
Northwest Portland. Each year, Zenith transports hundreds of millions of
gallons of crude oil by pipe and train from Canada through several Portland
neighborhoods to its facility in the Critical Energy Infrastructure Hub along
the Willamette River before shipping it out.
A coalition of climate advocates in Portland has long opposed Zenith’s
operations in the city out of concerns about air pollution and studies
showing that an oil train derailment or an earthquake could lead to a
devastating oil spill in the heart of the city.
Until several weeks ago, the commissioner in charge of BDS and Zenith’s
future in the city was Dan Ryan. Ryan was in charge when the city first
declined to grant Zenith a Land Use Compatibility Statement (LUCS)—a
permit the company needed to continue operating in Portland—in 2021,
ruling that Zenith’s fossil fuel operations were in conflict with Portland’s
climate goals.
Ryan was also in charge when the city then changed course and granted
Zenith a revised LUCS in October after the company promised to phase out
its use of crude oil over the next five years in favor of renewable fuels,
despite the vociferous opposition of a coalition of climate organizations
Then, in the reshuffle at City Hall, Wheeler swapped Ryan for Rubio—a
commissioner who, based on her public rhetoric, might have been
sympathetic to the concerns of activists. When asked by the Mercury at the
end of last year what her priorities for the second half of her council term
are, Rubio responded “Climate, climate, climate.”
But Rubio has all but announced that she is unwilling to revisit the city’s
LUCS decision—even though the city has the ability to revoke the LUCS at
any point before the Oregon Department of Environment Quality (DEQ)
grants Zenith the air permit it needs to continue operating its facility. The
DEQ is currently evaluating Zenith’s application for an air permit.
“I am serious about moving faster and more aggressively away from fossil
fuels,” Rubio wrote in a statement to the Mercury. “Last year we passed rules
to permanently halt the expansion of fossil fuel storage capacity at the
Critical Energy Infrastructure Hub, and we updated our Renewable Fuels
Standard to increase use of cleaner biodiesel and renewable diesel. The
decision made regarding the Zenith storage facility is in alignment with
those efforts, and it was processed in the same manner as every other Land
Use Compatibility Statement.”
Rubio made that position clear on January 17 when a group of community
organizations met with her and Ryan to voice their concerns about Zenith.
The commissioners were joined by members of their staff, City Attorney
Robert Taylor, and staff from BDS. The meeting didn’t last long—just half an
hour, ending before many of the advocates in the room had a chance to ask
questions.
“The tone was really to show how many people backed this decision,”
Audrey Leonard, a staff attorney at the climate justice organization
Columbia Riverkeeper, said
For the organizers in the room, the message was unmistakable: the city is
not willing to revisit its decision.
Nick Caleb, an attorney with the climate justice organization Breach
Collective, said the effect of the change in leadership at BDS from Rubio to
Ryan has been negligible despite Rubio’s climate-focused rhetoric.
“The only difference I’ve seen is that they’re less responsive so far,” Caleb
said of Rubio’s office. “The similarities between their offices is that they’re
both highly risk-averse people, and I think they just made the risk
assessment that [they’re] more scared of the business community than
[they] are of climate activists.”
In fact, Rubio and Ryan were working together on Zenith months before the
bureau reshuffle was announced.
Both commissioners attended what Rubio’s communications director
Jimmy Radosta described as an “educational meeting” about Zenith’s
operations at its facility in July, and public records obtained by Breach
Collective and shared with the Mercury suggest that Rubio’s office was in
communications with Ryan’s staff regarding public communications about
the project in the buildup and immediate aftermath of the city’s decision to
grant the LUCS in October.
According to Radosta, it was important for the two commissioners to keep
in contact about Zenith because of Rubio’s oversight of the Bureau of
Planning and Sustainability (BPS), which also played a role in overseeing
Zenith’s operations in the city.
“Commissioner Ryan’s office did a great job of keeping our office up to date
as the administrative process moved forward because of BPS’s role in
zoning and the Comprehensive Plan,” Radosta wrote in a message to the
Mercury.
Rubio wrote in her statement to the Mercury that she is unwilling to revisit
the LUCS decision and in doing so “create a different process for Zenith
that would result in the same outcome.”
But opponents of Zenith’s ongoing presence in the area find the city’s LUCS
decision baffling given the ongoing dangers posed by another five years of
Zenith transporting crude oil through a major urban center.
“It wasn’t that long ago that there was an [oil train] derailment in the Gorge
outside of Mosier, Oregon that but for a rare, windless day [we] basically
avoided a huge, catastrophic disaster,” Caleb said. “It was this big warning
for everybody that this is dangerous activity that we should try to get away
from as soon as possible.”
The city’s decision to grant Zenith’s LUCS was especially galling to those
groups given that it also approved the new application just weeks after it
was submitted, which Caleb believes was an unusually quick turnaround
time that was taken so the public couldn’t mobilize against it. BDS staff told
the Mercury that they aim to evaluate all LUCS applications within three
weeks.
As part of its successful LUCS application, Zenith has promised to phase
out 100 percent of its facility’s crude oil operations within the next five
years to align with the city’s climate efforts and agreed to allow city
inspectors to visit the facility to ensure that the company is complying with
the terms of the LUCS.
But Zenith has a well-documented history of misleading inspectors about
its operations in order to keep transporting crude oil—a point noted both
by climate activists and the city itself when it initially refused to grant the
LUCS in 2021.
“Zenith has proven themselves to be a bad actor, time after time and to say
what they need to say to regulators to get what they want,” Leonard said. “I
think that the city is really just wanting to get this out of the way and get it
over with.”
There are also questions about whether Zenith’s promised shift from crude
oil to renewable diesel is feasible in the set timeline.
“I imagine that in five years Zenith comes back to the city and says, ‘Oh, you
know, we said we were going to manage renewable diesel, but it turns out
that there’s not enough of it, so we want to keep handling whatever it is that
we want to keep handling,’” Melanie Plaut, a member of Oregon Physicians
for Social Responsibility, said.
Zenith has not transitioned to using exclusively renewable fuel at any of its
other facilities in the country, though it maintains that five years is the
maximum amount of time it will take to complete the transition in
Portland.
“We’re committed to helping the region reduce its transportation emissions
by converting all of our Portland terminal’s crude oil storage to renewable
fuels,” Grady Reamer, Vice President of US Operations for Zenith Energy,
wrote in a statement to the Mercury. “We hope this commitment —
combined with our agreement to reduce allowable air emissions by 80% at
our terminal — will be viewed favorably by DEQ.”
Even if Zenith does make the transition as it says it will, Zenith critics still
have safety concerns over the next five years and beyond. Plaut said that
renewable diesel is flammable and still potentially explosive, with the
effects of a derailment likely to disproportionately affect the lower-income
neighborhoods that the company runs its oil trains through.
Lenoard said that while climate activists still want to see “accountability”
from the city over the LUCS decision, their focus will now largely turn to
the DEQ process. Unlike the city, DEQ will have a public comment period
before deciding whether to grant Zenith a permit—giving opponents of
Zenith a chance to show the strength of their opposition.
“If a Zenith oil train derails… we literally know who to blame,” Caleb said.
“They could have made different decisions. And I don’t understand why
that's not more persuasive to the folks on city council.”
