WinCo will pay $3.6 million to settle a class action suit that alleged the company
misled thousands of customers into paying hidden surcharges on certain non-
grocery goods.
The settlement was reached during mediation before Oregon Senior Judge
Henry Kantor and follows an $8.8 million payout from Safeway to settle a
similar case.
Portland customers who bought non-grocery items from WinCo after Nov. 25,
2018, and who submit timely claims are anticipated to receive $200 each. Any
unclaimed money will be donated to nonprofits in Oregon that help consumers,
under the negotiated settlement.
