The city of Portland has filed a lawsuit against a local journalist and news
outlet in an attempt to block the public release of information about which
businesses were required to pay into a voter-approved climate program,
records show.
Monica Samayoa, an environmental reporter with Oregon Public
Broadcasting, filed a public records request with the city in October for a list
of all companies that paid into Portland’s clean energy fund in 2022 and the
amount of money each owed that year, according to a complaint filed
Monday in Multnomah County Circuit Court.
After the city denied her request, Samayoa appealed the decision to the
Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office, which ruled in her favor earlier
this month.
