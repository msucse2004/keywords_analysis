Celebrate Earth Day With Making Earth Cool
Under the pomp and ceremony of a costume parade on a beautiful spring day lay a deep reservoir of
disquiet for what the future might hold.

On Saturday, a parade of Portlanders marched from Sunnyside
Environmental School through quiet inner Eastside residential blocks,
celebrating Earth Day with the pageantry of handmade costumes and
musical accompaniment from Portland’s own Unpresidented Brass Band.
Led by a decommissioned fire engine, the procession of approximately 200
people—most dressed as animals and plants—drew neighbors and diners
out to watch the passing spectacle.
The event was organized by climate crisis-focused art collective Making
Earth Cool, Portland Youth Climate Strike, Sunnyside Environmental
School, and Extinction Rebellion PDX (a local chapter of the global
nonviolent civil disobedience movement), among others.
At the parade Angela McIlvain, Mel Shea, and Nora Colie—wearing their
respective ensembles as a globe with sunglasses "Earthy," a yellow flower
"Dandy," and a pink wildflower "Clover"—emphasized the importance of
this event being a multigenerational gathering and celebration. Under the
pomp and ceremony of families in costumes and the communal celebration
of Earth on a beautiful spring day, lies a deep reservoir of disquiet for what
the future might hold.
“The youth are going to experience a lot more climate change than we
have,” Shea told the Mercury. “There is an anxiousness to it, and we hope to
help people not feel alone.”

Many costumes were handmade with discarded goods, the products of a process of “upcycling” where items are spared the landfill
to be reimagined and made into other things. A number of the large puppets were made by 350PDX. JUSTIN YAU
