• Awash With Cash, Portland Clean Energy Fund Marks New Strategy With
Latest Investments
Over a third of the $300 million from the Clean Energy Fund's new program
will go to city bureaus, for projects with nonprofit partners. That's on top of
$623 million in PCEF funds approved earlier this month for climate
initiatives within city bureaus.

• POP QUIZ PDX!
How much do YOU remember about 2024? Let's find out in this week's
hilarious edition of POP QUIZ PDX! Including: Horrifying amusement park
rides, drowning cars, burning ballots, and MORE. See how well YOU score!

• A Complete Unknown Satisfies Only Your Lowest Expectations for a Bob
Dylan Biopic
A Complete Unknown provides no more thought on Bob Dylan than a
Wikipedia article. Read our disdainful review!

• The Mercury's Favorite Movies of 2024
Behold! A list of the best films of the year! Film critic Dom Sinacola on his
10 favorite features of 2024 and where you can watch them.
The Brutalist COURTESY A24
• Fairytale of Old Portland
For those who have lived (and have celebrated Christmas) in Portland, don't
miss this bittersweet love letter from Ben Coleman to a less shiny city, and
the teenagers, insomniacs, and eccentrics who populated it.
Dylan Meconis
• Hey Sexy! Take the Mercury's 2025 SEX SURVEY!
Have a horny holiday season by taking the Mercury's annual SEX SURVEY!
We want to know what you do, how you do it, and who you're doing it
with... and don't worry, it's completely anonymous. But hurry, hurry, the
survey ends soon!
• The Mercury's Favorite Books of 2024
Portland as ground zero for a zombie plague. Bisexual exes on a romcom
food and wine tour. And how pointless it is to try to guess what happens
next in a Miranda July novel.
• SAVAGE LOVE
Following an accident, he now suffers from premature ejaculation. His wife
wonders, "Will I ever be able to enjoyably ride my husband again?" Dan
Savage and a guest expert supply some hope in this week's SAVAGE LOVE!
Joe Newton
WOW, THAT IS A LOT OF GOOD READIN'. I hope you didn't have any
other plans this weekend! Dig in, and remember: Producing all this hard
work costs moolah—so please consider contributing to the Mercury to keep
it all coming! Thanks!
