Three members of the Portland City Council are exploring a potential
increase of a tax on large retailers that currently bankrolls the city’s lucrative
clean energy program in order to plug an estimated $93 million budget
gap in the city’s general fund.
Councilor Steve Novick told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Thursday that he
and Councilors Angelita Morillo and Jamie Dunphy want to raise the current
1% surcharge to 1.33% and divert the surplus revenue to core city services.
In addition, the trio says it wants to help Portland small businesses by raising
the exemption of the city’s business license tax from $50,000 on gross
receipts to $100,000.
