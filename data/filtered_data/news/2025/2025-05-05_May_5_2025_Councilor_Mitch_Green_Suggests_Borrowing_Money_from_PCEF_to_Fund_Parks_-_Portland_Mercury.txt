Councilor Mitch Green Suggests Borrowing
Money from PCEF to Fund Parks
Green's proposal comes as Mayor Keith Wilson floats deep cuts to Portland Parks & Recreation to fill a
budget shortfall.

As Portland leaders grapple with a major citywide budget shortfall, some
have sought potential relief from one of the city’s most prosperous
initiatives—the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund (PCEF).
The fund, which collects a 1 percent tax on local sales at large retailers to
pay for carbon reduction projects, has found major financial success while
other city programs and bureaus struggle to maintain basic services.
Councilor Mitch Green is now the latest member of City Council to suggest
a PCEF-related budget salve—and he thinks his proposal will fare better
than others his colleagues have recently floated. In a plan made public
today, Green proposed the city take out a short-term loan from unspent
PCEF funds to pay for parks maintenance programs, which are on the
chopping block in next year’s budget.
Green’s proposal comes after several other councilors have suggested their
own ideas for leveraging PCEF funds to support struggling city services.
Early last month, Councilors Steve Novick, Jamie Dunphy, and Angelita
Morillo put forward a plan to raise the PCEF tax from 1 to 1.33 percent,
with the surplus going to fill budget gaps. The councilors said the extra
revenue could amount to roughly $60 million a year for the city’s general
fund.
That idea, while appealing to some who want to see the business tax’s
success replicated, appears to be on shaky ground. It immediately
prompted backlash from climate and social justice advocates, including
Councilor Candace Avalos, who said the proposal “poses long-term risks to
[the fund] and undermines the firewall established between this fund and
city budget politics.” Portland’s tax-averse business leaders also didn’t like
the idea. In a rare show of unity, the Portland Metro Chamber joined
nonprofits APANO and Verde in a letter opposing the .33 percent increase.
Councilor Eric Zimmerman—who chairs the Council’s Finance Committee
—has also indicated a desire to use PCEF revenue for other purposes,
calling the program a contingency fund.
“We don’t have a budget problem, we have a priorities problem,”
Zimmerman said in a March social media post. “I’m not asking Portlanders
for more levy taxes while we’re sitting on half a billion dollars that could
make neighborhoods safer, parks cleaner, and help improve responsive
public safety teams.”
But much of PCEF’s revenue is accounted for. Late last year, the previous
City Council approved the fund’s five-year, $1.5 billion spending plan, with a
majority of the money going to city bureaus for climate work. Green says his
proposal keeps that in mind.
“Portlanders want us to keep our parks running and invest in a clean future.
We can and should do both, and this plan does exactly that,” he says.
“Unlike other proposals, this doesn’t take a dime from PCEF—every dollar
will be repaid before it’s needed for climate programs.”
Green’s plan, dubbed “Healthy Parks, Healthy Climate,” proposes borrowing
between $20 and $80 million starting in the upcoming budget period and
putting it aside to fill gaps in the city’s discretionary general funds. This
would help the city avoid “unacceptable cuts,” and buy time for Portland
leaders to figure out some longstanding budget woes.
Green, an economist by trade, says he recognizes the plan’s potential risks.
But he thinks the benefits will be greater, not only for the city’s struggling
bureaus, but also for PCEF itself.
The clean energy fund looks a lot different today than it did when the
program was approved as a ballot measure in 2018. Originally expected to
generate less than $100 million annually, PCEF was established to pay for
community-based clean energy projects, with a special focus on programs
benefitting people in historically underserved communities. But with
revenue far outpacing early estimates, program leaders had to make some
changes. Along the way, program advocates have worked to ensure the fund
stays true to its intended mission.
The Albina One building, currently in construction in North Portland, received early PCEF funding.

Last year, as Portland City Council grappled with a smaller budget shortfall,
commissioners allocated a one-time transfer of $7.6 million from PCEF’s
interest dividends to the city’s general fund. Members of the PCEF
Committee, the volunteer body meant to oversee the program, gave their
tacit approval to the decision, but said they hoped it wouldn’t set a
precedent for the city to siphon money from the program.
It appears that precedent has been set, though. Mayor Keith Wilson’s
proposed Fiscal Year 2025-26 budget includes an $18.7 million transfer from
the clean energy fund’s generated interest to the general fund.
Green says PCEF is at risk, given “mounting pressure…to solve our general
fund imbalance” for the next fiscal year. He says it’s worth weighing the
risks of borrowing from the fund—for example, the possibility of a future
City Council defaulting on the loan—with the risks of doing nothing as city
leaders continue to see PCEF as a way to bail out the general fund.
“My view is that the loan method is the best defense for PCEF as it places it
in a position to support the city in a time of great need, while reasserting
that our planned community driven programs are worth protecting,” Green
says.
As Wilson's budget proposal settles and city leaders hammer out the
details, Green said the bridge loan may not end up being necessary. Still, he
said, he "wanted to ensure we have all tools available to keep our parks and
climate whole as we navigate this budget cycle."
Green plans to present his proposal to the PCEF Committee at their
meeting this Wednesday. If his plan gets the Committee’s support, he’ll
bring it to City Council for discussion in upcoming budget hearings.
