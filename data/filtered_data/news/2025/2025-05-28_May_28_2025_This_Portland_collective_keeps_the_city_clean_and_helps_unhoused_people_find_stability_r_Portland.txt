Interesting article, and helpful to hear the backstory of humans involved in the waste system. I do wish the
author had visited Delta Park bottle drop, to see why they could have added additional context to this
paragraph:
"Last year, hundreds of Portlanders blocked a new bottle dropoff location proposed in the neighborhood of
St. Johns. They cited “safety” concerns and a “potential increase in crime or vandalism.”

I drop cans at the Delta Park bottle drop for my kid’s PTA, and I would not want that thing anywhere close
to where I live. I am thankful the residents in St Johns were able to block development.
When I was last there just a few weeks ago I saw someone selling drugs from a car and a line was forming
(I told security and they went over), and there were many people doing “the lean” in the BottleDrop line
and prepping drugs in the open. It was easily the worst I’ve seen it in a while. I won’t take my kid with me;
and I feel lucky to just be using the drop and go window since I’m not getting money back myself.

I shop at that Lowe’s and literally go out of my way to avoid using that drop. The number of water
bottle caps littered around Delta Park is insane.

I drop off blue bags there for my kids PTA as well as shop at the Lowe’s. It’s a complete zoo there in
the parking lot when the bottle drop is open. And the craziness migrates to the Dollar store too.
Seems to not affect Fisherman’s Marine, but then again they have a gun store inside, and maybe the
crazies know to stay away.
St. Johns neighborhood dodged a bullet here by not allowing a bottle drop to be installed in their
neighborhood. The places attract sone very undesirable types of people. Keep the bottle drops out of
neighborhoods.

Yeah I’ve seen security following them around in Lowe’s, good times.

Interesting how they mentioned the blockage of the St. Johns BottleDrop location without offering much
explanation only a vague suggestion that it was a NIMBY issue or somehow negative.
I'm not saying the program is inherently bad, but Portland, now more than ever, needs nuance. These
programs come with real issues that often go unaddressed. I understand the low-barrier approach and the
lack of drug testing, but at the end of the day, this feels like we're simply giving people jobs and presenting it
as if it’s a groundbreaking solution.

Hey, did you post this in reaction to the Buy Nothing request for that new start up org that clearly overlaps
Ground Score (wonderful group)?
Not blaming you if you did, just curious.

Gee wonder why this isn’t garnering the same amount of discussion here than all the negative homelessness
post that floods this subreddit.
Shocked.

Well yours is the only comment and it's negative, so maybe ask yourself? Things like this are great but we
need well-run, city/county/state-wide programs.

Probably because there's very little that is objectionable about it, seems like a mostly positive program
that encourages work, responsibility, and participating in the social contract, versus other articles and
