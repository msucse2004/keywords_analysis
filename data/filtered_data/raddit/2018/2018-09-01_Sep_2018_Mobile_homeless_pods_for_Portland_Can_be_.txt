After having a look at the article and seeing the inside, I can say that they'll be extremely difficult to clean and
I imagine most will end up being scrapped after someone really "does a number" on them. I understand and
appreciate the sentiment of things like this but it will do nothing other than absorb more tax money.

ooooh. Let's give them a comfortable place to live while they terrorize everyone and steal everything in sight.
Brilliant.

Had it occurred to you that I'm most cases a stable place to live will keep them from causing trouble?

The criminal transient element of the homeless population steals for drug money, so unless these
small homes come with a free, taxpayer funded stash, this will not "keep them from causing trouble"
and instead will only enable them and provide incentives for more to come here. More freebies and
zero law enforcement regarding their theft and their drug habits . . . if you were a drug abuser and
stole to support your habit where would you go?

They don't want jobs or a place to live. They want to get high and hang out. And they'll do
whatever they feel like doing to survive with that lifestyle. They don't care about me, you, or a
tiny house. They'd burn down a tiny house or sell the parts of it. It's very sad they are the way
they are and some bad things probably happened to them that helped make them that way.
They are never going to change.

you’re an ignorant dick lol nobody wants to live on the street. nobody wants to be in
those conditions. i’ve been on and off homeless since 15 and all i do is try to get out of
the situation. if you ever actually talked to anyone instead of hiding in your house and
pretending homeless people are what’s in your way of being a good and successful
person when really it’s just that you’re a close minded prick.

Mental health is a service. What do they do after the bus takes them home?

That sounds an awful lot like "not my problem". Is that what you meant?

LeviStubbsAlive •7y ago
The people whose problem they were, have decided they cant be helped. Why it falls to us, to
tolerate their bad behavior and fund a lifestyle that is a public health issue, is beyond my
understanding.

as though the homeless are the only people who ever misbehave and as though you’re
more than likely not funding homeless at all, moreso people with places to live but no
jobs and kids to take care of.

Reading this I just love the assumption you both make that homeless people have a home to
go to.
They don't. What their "home" and/or "family" decided to do about them was reject them and
leave them to die for whatever reason already in the past. You can't send them back to a
home. They don't have one. That's why they're homeless.

I find it suspicious that as soon as it gets sunny the are ten times as many of them
hanging out. They have places to go. Most are here on a crime spree camping trip.

They are “travelers”. They come here, as well as other major west coast cities because
we “tolerate them” here. We are part to blame for this mess by a certain level of
enabling behavior, our sympathy for someone who is down in their luck etc. but the
problem is that these people are taking advantage of our generous attitude, and have
turned it into a road warrior free for all where their drug use, crime, and filth are not
dealt with. They know there is no consequence to their behaviors here, and they come
in droves to enjoy that lifestyle. In the mean time, we, the hard working “normal”
people have to suffer with it. The police have been told not to enforce the laws
against these people, and as such, the problem will grow, until we finally do
something about it. It’s drugs, plain and simple. Until the law is changed where we can
force someone to go through a rehab program, it will never end. A few pods for the
truly down and out are great to get them back on path again, but the druggies need
medical help, and some city sponsored pod aren’t addressing this in the slightest.

It's this mindset that keeps the homeless around, the tourists out, and businesses moving
out of Downtown. It's gotten dramatically worse over the years because of all the
sympathetic residents that continue to enable them. Ted Wheeler even noted himself that
there were only 139 camps when he got to office 3 years ago. There are now 3,000.... let
that sink in.
He told Koin 6, "We went from basically zero to $33 million just at the city of Portland over
a course of a couple of years in terms of what we're spending specifically on the homeless
crisis that doesn't even include the housing," meaning the more we fund services, the
more and more they stick around.
I don't know about any of you, but I'm tired of getting harassed on my lunch break,
stepping over human feces to get into my office, and seeing piss run down a sidewalk
from some vacant doorway because someone passed out drunk.
Oh, we also had a neighbor move into an abandoned house down the street from us in
North Portland. Do you want to know what the police's response was? "Well we tried
contacting the owner of the property but couldn't get in touch, and the supposed
occupant said they have permission to be there, so there's nothing we can do." Two days
later, while walking my non-homeless dog, the dude was just chilling on the front porch,

and out every afternoon, and the cops can't do anything about it. Create
At least I know where to get some dope if I ever want to pick up the habit. Maybe then
the taxpayers will take care of me?

Wait til they move in, lock the door and take them to the Deep South, they’ll fit right in with the other poor
methheads there, plus this would be a mansion like status symbol

That was under the ownership and control of a homeless person. These pods would be under the
ownership and control of the city. As such they would not be positioned in inconvenient locations, could
be repositioned in response to citizen feedback, and would be regularly returned to a dedicated facility
for cleaning and repair such that they would not become unhygienic or a dilapidated eyesore.

[deleted] •7y ago
You mean “the city that works”? These things WILL turn into a unhygienic dilapidated mess as soon as
the city finds some new shiny pet project, and cut funding from this one. Wouldn’t be the first time
something like that has happened in this town.

[deleted] •7y ago
Who is going to want to clean those? The same people who don’t want to shovel human shit off the
streets? SF (non-comparison to Portland, but example here) pays its “street sanitation” workers
upwards of 100k per year to deal with the mess their homeless make. Part of this whole city budget
would need to go to pay whomever cleans these REALLY well or else they will very quickly just
become another part of the street city we have to avoid.
