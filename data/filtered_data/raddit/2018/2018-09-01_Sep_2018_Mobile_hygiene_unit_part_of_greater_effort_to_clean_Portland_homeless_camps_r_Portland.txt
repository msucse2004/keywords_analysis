They put one near me a while ago, but it attracted some really, really, really shady, really messy people who
would linger and walk out in the middle of the road and just convene around it. I like the idea, but it needs to
be strategically placed to better serve both the homeless population so that they are safer and that you don't
piss off the residents.

Shocking. Continued enablement without any enforcement is just causing more problems?

Why don't we just round these people up and concentrate them somewhere? Maybe like a camp or
something? Right? I mean what sort of enforcement do you have in mind? Prison for being at the
bottom of the fucking totem pole of our society? Dickensian Britain is alive and well in 21st century
America.

Honestly there are either side of the coin in homeless camps. Those that find a way to make life
work day to day, organized, clean, and those greedy shady stealthy people who make you feel
nervous. About the same with any area depending on what you are looking for, the real quality of
Portland is giving things away free, curb side donation, just give and let roll the blessing some
have to others. The weather is what brings people here, temperature where you can sleep outside
without dying is important. Real world on the first world. Who is on the totem pole?

Boring
The only totem pole I've seen is drifting... Horizontally... Through a seemingly empty sea.
Waterlogged and sinking faster every day. I'm still tryna make my way to it. Gotta be better
than drowning alone.

I saw this recently near the camps along the fence above 84 at Grand/Lloyd Blvd
they were pretty dug in there, had been there for weeks. The mobile hygeine unit showed up, then the camps
got cleared, and it stuck around in the middle of an empty field for a few days.
i'm not suggesting they're related, it was probably coincidence, but it doesn't seem like a good use of
resources to leave it there? if they're going to clear an area that has one of these they ought to notify the
office responsible for the hygiene station

I saw a little kid at one of those tents. It is near the Oregon government building.

What about all those closed public bathrooms everywhere downtown? Just reopen them or build new ones.
I see shit like this and it makes me think of how Seattles paying $1,500 a month per parking spot for
homeless vehicles when they could just implement a better solution for the same cost.

Really?! When did Seattle implement that? That didn’t exist when I lived there.

This person is an idiot that pulls baseless statements out of their ass, don't take anything they say
seriously.

Article from 4 days ago regarding it.

Funny how it makes you think of Seattle paying $1500 a month, not the churches in Seattle and the city
of Santa Barbara doing it for a fraction of the cost. It's even mentioned in the article you posted!

If you build it, they will come.
