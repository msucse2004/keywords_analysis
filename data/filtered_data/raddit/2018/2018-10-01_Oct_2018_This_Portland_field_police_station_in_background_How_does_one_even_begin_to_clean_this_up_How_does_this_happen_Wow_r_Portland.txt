Judging by the mess and it's contents at a glance this looks like at one point this might have actually been a
functioning camp but were shooed away by the city and this is the mess that's left after destroying the camp
just waiting for the clean up crew to show up. I know when the police come in regardless if the homeless
people are the "trouble making type" or not after they tell you to leave if you don't they just start destroying
any and all structures of any kind indiscriminately.
But that's just my guess, I don't hang around that area enough to really know for sure.

Gumbo_Booty • 7y ago
Loose definition of functioning.

Monkeydud64 •7y ago
Generally yes, but you would be surprised how much infrastructure these camps can actually have
sometimes. It's a new breed of homeless people out there since the housing crisis started. It's not
longer window pie stealing hobo Joe down on his luck or just drug addicts, it's whole family's out
there. People who have been kicked out of their homes or apartments because of rent hikes, People
with jobs, people with actual skills. That's why so many of these camps are so much bigger now then
they used to be.

Could also be Hillbillies illegally dumping. There are some off the beaten path places in Clackamas

Or, even more likely, the homeless started this mess and assholes just kept adding to it.

It's not a political policy.
When homeless people camp on public land you can't just tell them to leave. This kind of thing does
get taken to court and historically the homeless won.

You put a notice up and they have to move. That is the standard process in Portland. Homeless
aren't going to win there. You can't camp on public property. We wouldn't be playing the cat and

Anyone with a criminal law background know why this isn’t charged as illegal dumping?

Monkeydud64 •7y ago
It's also a good chance this was a camp already run off by the city making this the city's mess technically
and it's just waiting for their clean up crews to get to it finally out of the others of way worse sites they
clean up on a daily.
Souce: My friend used to work for said clean up crews untill recently cleaning up literal mountains of
dumped trash/junk/camps for the city

WolfsLairAbyss • 7y ago
Who would they charge? I don't see any tents up so most likely the camp has been abandoned. Good
luck tracking the homeless drifters who made that mess.

Ashe-Whole •7y ago •Edited 7y ago
Offensive littering (dumping) is considered to be a form of criminal mischief in Oregon (Class C
Misdemeanor), which is why I asked.
I realize that the PPB has other priorities, but I was more interested in why the County DA wouldn’t
file charges, especially given the local government’s stance on pollution in waterways. Hence my
question was directed at charging, not the role of law enforcement officers.

I would be willing to bet money that if there were shady looking vans and trailers parked
amid that field of garbage there was some kind of drug use going on. Sure, there is a
chance that is not the case but if you have been around these camps for very long you
know what is going on there. Additionally, nobody said that they were going to be shot
on sight if the plate numbers were given to the police. Stopped and questioned, or maybe
searched would be more my guess.

Sadly, I've known a few junkies in my time. Some people engage in steal-hoard-and-
destroy behavior when they're strung out, which can be both gross and disturbing
(and potentially a public health risk, not to mention the fact that junkies stealing what
they later destroy is not acceptable).
But people with nothing don't have access to trash collection. They can't necessarily
buy new things when the old ones break, let alone pay to have them hauled away.
Modern human produce trash, whether or not they live indoors, so trash at a camp is
not necessarily due to drug use, theft, or other criminal activity.
It may very well be that the folks in those vans were shooting up, smoking crack, or
illegally dumping trash. But if they weren't seen engaging in illegal activity, why
assume so and turn their info into the police? How is that helping anyone?

brn30076 OP •7y ago
I agree but at the very least they where illegally camping . Trashing someone else’s
property , trespassing . Morally in the wrong . The list goes on of reasons this is
unacceptable . It really is time we make this shit an enforced crime .

Illegal camping is technically a crime, but it's no where near my greatest
concern. And for what it's worth, federal courts have ruled that arresting
someone for sleeping outside violates their right to freedom from cruel &
unusual punishment, if there's no where in shelters etc. to refer them to. Our
area shelters are often full.
If someone is trespassing on private property (like a person's yard, vs. a public
sidewalk or abandoned lot), causing property destruction, or stealing things,
then yes--I agree that these crimes that should be more strictly enforced. If

they're driving up in a vehicle & tossing out trash, I think they should be
ticketed and fined. Create
Telling someone they're immoral for trying to find a place to sleep, however?
What would you do if there were no where indoors, nowhere legal, for you to
rest your head? Where would you put your garbage if you had no trash
collection service? In my opinion, the fact that so many of our neighbors can't
afford basic housing, food & medical care is immoral. America is among the
richest nations in the world.
