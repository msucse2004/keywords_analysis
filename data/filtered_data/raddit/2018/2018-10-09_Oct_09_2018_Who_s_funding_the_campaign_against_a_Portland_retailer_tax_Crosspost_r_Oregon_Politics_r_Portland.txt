I'm fine with sales tax (or even hidden sales taxes like this one) if and only if it is paired with an equal
reduction of income taxes on the lower brackets (under $70k). We have one of the highest income taxes
in the nation and at some income levels your taxes are more than in California, which is supposed to be
the worst.

Yeah, I'd support a sales tax if and only if it came with a blowjob from an entire school bus full of
college cheerleaders.
But, that's not the way reality or taxes work.

I think the tax reform plan is more likely than your cheerleader blowjob plan, although I admit
neither is very likely.

The lower brackets dont pay enough to offset a sales tax.

California, which is supposed to be the worst
Which has never been true, it's just a big conservative talking point because blah blah California
liberals, so it must be bad. California actually has one of the lowest effective tax rates in the country
for median income earners, and is only ranked #10 in terms of total tax burden.

Portland voters are typically a tax-friendly electorate.

You know, other than completely crippling property taxes in the 90s.

If $7k (up 60% in 10 years) is 'completely crippled' then I definitely couldnt afford able-bodied.

my property taxes right now sit a 4.2K. in doing a little math with out measure 5 and the current
value of the place, that tax would probably be closer to 9K

Measures 5 and 50 are major reasons why local government budgets are in such poor shape in
Oregon. Bill Sizemore has done immense damage to generations of Oregonians.
Property taxes within Portland are absurd, especially on new/remodeled homes, because we have
an astonishing number of people not paying their fair share. Appeals are likely to fail unless you
have a significant amount of time and money. This is how we end up with million dollar homes
with smaller tax bills than homes half their size.

Cripling not crippled. You guys are in agreement.

Shocker. Business don’t like taxes.
1. Ask yourself whose really funding the yes side of this measure. Then recall the incremental strategy we
used to get marijuana legalized. Consider that these little taxes are the same strategy.
Taxes never go away. I will never vote for a sales tax unless it’s coupled with a reduction in income or property
taxes. I like sales tax because it only taxes the money you spend. But I am not in favor of increasing my tax
burden by introducing any form a sales tax. They trying to cook the frog y’all.

I don't give a fuck who is backing this campaign, I am going to vote against it if there is even the most
remote possibility this will somehow be passed down to me in any way, shape or form. I am already taxed up

Our businesses are already doing poorly in the area, no need to tax them any further. This isn't good for our
local economy.

heavily represented. Is a 1% tax enough for them to move operations?
Fast food chains are likely exempt due to the franchised structure, right?
No more than 5% of the fund shall be spent on expenses associated with administering the fund once
established
Presumably 5% was picked because it polls well, not because it's realistic.
Its backers include more than 100 grassroots groups, which have raised more than $240,000 for the
yes campaign, mostly from nonprofits supporting communities of color.
Not surprised, considering 20% of the tax is earmarked to go directly to them. Should be a fantastic revenue
stream for these orgs, considering how buried and quickly forgotten a tax like this is.
I voted No on 97 and the arts tax, the fact that stuff like this is a shoo-in is why I'm avoiding living within
Portland city limits these days

fidelitypdx •7y ago•Edited 7y ago

Lots of people don't realize how easily these companies make decisions that greatly impact our
communities.
Take a look at Vigor:
https://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2018/09/shipbuilder_choosing_between_p_1.html
If this tax goes anywhere near Vigor, we can kiss those 200-300 well paying union jobs good bye.
Anyone concerned about working class jobs needs to be against this bill. We don't grow our working
class economy by taxing corporations - in fact the exact opposite happens, by granting tax breaks we get
jobs. That's how the real world works.
Let's not forget the lesson of Seattle's Amazon Tax - a meager $47 million dollar tax damn near drove a
billion dollar company out of Seattle. That's 44,000+ employees that would be slowly downsized because
they didn't want to pay a $500 head tax per employee. Starbucks would have been next to relocate.
