Portland City Club looked in the the issue of prices being raised after taxation of corporations. They found no
empirical evidence to support the claim. This is one of those Econ 101 theories that people spout without any
supporting arguments beyond "that's just how it works". Billion dollar retailers set their prices nationwide. The
price of goods on Amazon in Arkansas is no different than the price in Alaska.
Beyond the lack of reality-based evidence, it beggars belief that supply-side economics is still considered to
be the framework corporations operate within. The complexity of the global market on pricing will not be
affected by a minuscule business license surcharge in one small city. The corporations affected by this
measure just received the largest tax break in history from the federal administration. Why didn't prices go
down?
On a more subjective front, it is difficult for me to see the "prices will increase" argument as anything more
than a threat. Corporations are accountable to the communities they operate in, and the people who use

“Billion dollar retailers set their prices nationwide”. No, they don’t at least as far as AMZN goes. Those
gold box deals are driven by user behavior across a number of ML algorithms. You and I won’t see the
same price if we’re in different cohorts.
Shipping costs also come into effect for large big box items.
Not arguing with anything else you said but this assertion is wrong.

AstralMarmot •7y ago
You're probably right about deals and shipping, but that seems incidental to baseline pricing.
Comcast, who put tens of thousands of dollars in to opposing this, sets their prices regionally too if
I'm not mistaken. But that region is far larger than one city, and it's implausible that they would raise
prices on Vancouver WA to keep profit margins up in an area where they have an almost complete
monopoly.
My Lyft driver the other day worked for Comcast. He told me their fee raises were on a schedule, and
another one was due this winter, regardless of any changes in local taxation. It's kind of amazing to
me that they tried to frame their opposition around concern for Portland's affordability (their PAC was
literally called Keep Portland Affordable). Amazing and brazen. Preying on the real fears of people
being driven from their homes, in a city with no-cause evictions, while continuing to raise fees on
their users, is pretty repugnant.

Comcast isn't even regionally. It can differ city to city.

You are technically correct.
However, there is no evidences this will change the algorithm that sets the prices. Effectively the same

They just fire employees and prices don't rise. They cut costs elsewhere. There is ALWAYS a negative to

No, they don't. Why is that widely disproved thing keep getting spread?
I'm going to give a brief summary of why that is flawed, there are many well written papers by expert
you are more then welcome to dig up and read.
Company hire the absolute minimum they need to get the work done. They don't have excess to cut.
"There is ALWAYS a negative to taxing business."
Nope.
" If there wasn't, you would tax them 100%."
Your fallacy extreme argument can take a hike. Tax 100% would be a negative, so we don't do that.

This was pretty popular with voters – who seem more comfortable putting taxes on huge
national/international corporations rather than smaller locally owned businesses. Especially for a popular
cause like clean energy.
I wouldn't be surprised if other cities look toward it as a model.

EVERYBODY NEEDS TO STOP SAYING THIS!
Portland voters approved the arts tax in 2012 with a 62 percent "yes" vote. As of June 2017, it has brought
in $47.8 million, with nearly 10 percent spent on overhead costs. The net amount goes to the Regional
Arts & Culture Council, which gives out arts-related grants, and also pays for arts teachers in the six local
districts that lie partly or wholly inside city limits – Centennial, David Douglas, Parkrose, Portland Public
Schools, Reynolds and Riverdale.

What can I tell you, besides PERS handcuffs Oregon school budgets? Every time a bond passes to
increase school funding, PERS hoovers up the money. And don’t get me started on admin bloat.
But Oregon schools are well funded, as evidenced by this Arts Tax. Whether the SCHOOLS are
mismanaging the money is another topic for another day but that’s not totally the City’s fault for
instituting the tax. I’d rather the City make sure the revenue was well spent than that they
eliminate the tax.
Having said that I’m not one of those people that thinks we should screw a bunch of faithful
longtime public servants at the time when they’re most vulnerable. If for no other reason than
who in their right mind would ever agree to a deal with the government if the government could
freely rescind negotiated compensation after-the-fact? Our credibility would be devastated, and
that’s when you’d REALLY see government incompetence.
Just make sure that we can pay the retirees the money they’ve earned as well as adequately fund
the schools. (And cut down on admins for the love of god). It’s expensive, but it isn’t rocket
science

So, I don't disagree that PERS is a problem, but what you typed isn't true. A bond is for a
capital expense, like a new building. PERS is an operating expense.
Bond revenue can't go to PERS. Operating levies can, but the huge bonds that PPS has
recently passed aren't operating money.

dotcomse •7y ago
Hosford-Abernethy
My mistake on the terminology. I can’t remember last time an operating levy was on the
ballot, but I do know that it annoyed members of my family that people would vote to
increase school funding and that instead that tax payment would go (in part) to
retirement pensions. Think they thought it was disingenuous, but that’s where the
phenomenon came to my attention
Worth noting that there is a thing called a “PERS Bond” but it doesn’t appear to be
relating to any ballots - unless the District can only issue bonds with voter approval. I’m
not sure about that. Sounds like a heinous gamble though and borrowing to pay for that
stuff needs to stop.
http://www.wweek.com/news/2018/10/04/current-and-former-oregon-lawmakers-file-
ballot-initiative-to-block-further-pers-debt/
Here's how the issuance of so-called "PERS bonds" are supposed to work: the borrower
issues bonds that pay, for example, four percent interest. The borrower takes the proceeds
of the bond issuance and invests them in stocks and private equity and earns, for the sake
of argument, eight percent. That four percentage-point difference between borrowing
costs and investment returns can then be applied to paying down PERS obligations. (And
of course the exercise can fail if investment returns turn out to be less than the cost of
borrowing. That has happened.)

Hosford-Abernethy
Please take a breath and re-read what I wrote. Perhaps also read the other
comments I've posted here where I've indicated that PERS obligations should be
honored. Perhaps at that point you will understand that the sentence "borrowing
to pay for that stuff needs to stop" was intended to mean something different
from what you understood it to mean. Perhaps you will understand that I meant
that in a robust economy we should be taxing and continually paying for our
obligations instead of issuing debt.
If you look through the world with a certain lens, you're going to see things to be
indignant about that people didn't actually say or mean.
EDITED TO ADD: Furthermore, literally borrowing money to play the stock market
is an objectively bad call. That's where I wrote "borrowing to pay for that stuff
needs to stop" - and if you think the government borrowing money to play the
stock market is a GOOD idea, I really don't know what to tell you.

Portlanders especially love taxes they don't have to pay. Most of us are the biggest bunch of cheap skates I've
encountered before. Hell, even Jo Ann Hardesty didn't even bother to file for taxes in the city and county she
resides in and conducts business which is a no-no; but she'll be presumably pushing for harder taxes on
businesses and individuals. Is this hypocrisy, doublethink, or cognitive dissonance -- or people just don't care
to think critically on these issues?
I remember the collective shitting of pants when there was even a consideration of additional beer taxes in
2008-ish. Or just like the Arts Tax when people realized they were implicated in the tax they voted in
afterwards. I voted "no" on that blatant bullshit and paid diligently and on-time every year and will continue
to do so. I wonder if the same burnout skinny-dick listless hipsters that voted that garbage in even bothered
to pay or even are around anymore?
There seems to be a totally delusional condition in America on both sides of the coin (no taxes but wants
stuff vs. wants lots of taxes only on wealthy and lots of stuff) Related to taxes, I think the Democratic party is
being pushed by a radical, progressive agenda that won't go anywhere tangible in the U.S. and is going to
bifurcate more to the benefit of Republicans.
Progressive Dems want a Nordic Style Welfare System only on "rich" businesses and individuals only, when in
reality MANY of its citizens and businesses in Nordic countries are heavily taxed and there is more of an
overall contribution of taxation to the system by all (or just look at what happened to France when they tried
only taxing the wealthy recently). Let's see, am I going to sit around paying 90% income taxes or live on my
yacht in a tax haven of tropical paradise? Just see what happened to France when they promised taxes on
wealthy to fund social programs. Further complicating this, they argue these countries are "socialist" which
they're not, but totally gloss over the real economic atrocities of countries that have endeavored in socialism
type economies.
I'm still waiting for the day some common sense moderates in this country (and city) start running for office.
My observations is the average voter is too lazy to even understand who or what they're voting for anymore.
I'm not dumb enough to vote for any Trump-esque Republican; but I downright refuse to even bother
voting for someone who parades around selling "socialism" and a half-baked social welfare programs they
promise to people to get votes.
I'd be curious to think of who the Democrats support in 2020, I know this will be central to where the party
goes. It will be interesting to say the least but count me out if Bernie et. al. are on the ticket.

I was specifically referring to the ongoing push towards progressive candidates for the party. I was
very specific in that description.
These high tax rates were influential the modern Republican party. Partly, the reason for them was to
pay down war debt and the rise of globalism wasn't at the levels we have now. In other words, we
could get away with high taxes as we became the manufacturer of the world in rebuilding war
ravaged Europe.
1940s to 1970s level of taxation at those marginal rates is DOA. We won't be able to compete with a
global economy, we could then because we were the only place not fucked from the war and more
developed.
Just some minor details.
Further, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is lower than that of most industrialized countries.
I'm not commenting on current taxation levels. I'm taking about the "progressive" wing of Dems.

You make fair points. To be honest I skimmed your post and picked out the part that stuck in my

taxation policies, I hadn't thought too much about them and, though they're counter to my "eat
the rich!" beliefs (no this is not satire, not really), they're clearly integral to the conversation.
FWIW, I wasn't here at the time to vote for the Arts Tax (lived in Eugene), but I would've voted for
it, and even though it is regressive and I'm on the lower-income side, I happily pay it now.

I do wish for further discussions on taxation at all levels, unfortunately my belief is people are
too entrenched into "taxes are good" vs "taxes are evil" mindsets. Point in case, the recent
Trump tax cuts has increased our deficit, yet the spending hawks are quietly blaming social
programs as the cause (despite tax cuts being isolated as the exacerbating factor of the recent

Well the Laffer curve as I understand it generally posits that high taxes won't

I don't have the economic background or financial knowledge to pick apart
the theory, but it seems to generally hold true there might be a "sweet spot"
with respect to levels of taxation that maximizes revenues but does not
diminish economic investment and activity.
90 percent marginal rates seem counterproductive and socially can breed
animosity amongst people, as an example.
I don't know what that means in terms of tax levels we should pursue,

I think closer to 50% probably wouldn’t too greatly stifle economic activity
if it was at a level above, say $5M/yr. People that make that much look at
money like a score in a videogame. I want more money because I want my
life to improve - whereas the very wealthy seem to be willing to act
against their own happiness to swell their net worth. They’d keep working
even if the government took a bigger chunk, I think.

This is a very niche, and specific tax. It's being broadly assessed on a all types of business solely on
gross income to fund a narrow scope (i.e., energy funding for weatherization and something focusing
on "undeserved" communities).
IMO niche taxes should be assessed on specific businesses that are affecting the problem. What
does a big box retailer have anything to do with weatherization for "undeserved" communities? It's
borderline nonsensical. I've heard the crazies hanging outside my place make more sense than that. It
would be akin to taxing prescription medicine to fund road improvements. (Whereas taxing gas or
miles traveled makes the most sense because the use and damage of roads is generally correlated to
gas/miles traveled).
Regarding this specific tax, taxing energy type-companies an excise tax would make more sense.
Potentially state laws would limit this and this is why we went this route. Generally, I support taxes
that can fix the problem at hand (e.g., tax bad foods to fund health care).
The last street fee the city proposed was the biggest stupidity ever -- it didn't even address car drivers
who do most damage, it went after a class of people, and the tax design would have separated the
corollary nature of "user fees"...someone who paid little tot he street fee could then slap on studded
tires and drive a million miles, yet someone who drive nowhere could be saddled with a huge bill.

taysto • 7y ago
You say that there's no correlation between the parties that get hit with this fee and what the
revenue from this surcharge will go toward, but the reasoning is pretty clear in that
national/transnational corporations contribute to climate change and/or social injustice
significantly whether it be through inefficiencies via supply chain, outsourcing their labor to areas
with less protections for their employees, increased emissions from production or delivery of
products...etc.
So them being on the hook for their social and environmental impacts even at a local level is still
relevant to alleviating social inequities and implementing climate change mitigation measures like
energy efficiency and renewable energy infrastructure.

Well stated. Hiding behind a long chain from cause to effect is a major way corporations
evade accountability.

I know entirely the difference and that was articulated in my post. Note, how I clearly and accurately
defined Nordic Countries as NOT socialist. Read what I'm writing you hack.

Currently none, but then why does Bernie Sanders call himself a Socialist but confusingly point to
Nordic Europe countries as models of "democratic socialist" when these countries are market based
economies? Does he have ulterior motives after he gets elected? Why the confusion? Why are there
candidates running who are apart of the of the Democratic Socialist Party, such as Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez?

The money is allocated toward existing homes, particularly rental homes, and non-profits. Almost 50% of
Portland homes have zero weatherization. For many Portlanders, particularly minorities and immigrants,
this means having to chose between putting food on the table and heating their homes in the winter. The
fund also allocates money toward job training in the clean energy sector, targeted toward people who are
traditionally excluded from emerging economies, and green spaces in heavily concreted neighborhoods.
In addition, if a rental home receives weatherization and clean energy upgrades, it places a rent cap on
the home so landlords can't screw their tenants over based on increased market viability.

Is there a betting pool on when the law suit is filed?
I'm putting my money on Q1 next year.

As an example, I'm sure Walmart has a team of lawyers on retention to explore legal options just in
case local voters get uppity like this. I'm sure Kroger, Target, Costco, and many others feel it's a better
investment to spend $5 million on lawyers now than pay this tax for the next 25 years.

I'm not sure precisely what they'll sue over, and who all the plaintiffs will be, but I have zero doubt
