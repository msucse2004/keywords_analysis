I hope this doesn't mean prices will go up at My Father's Place.

Isn’t that what the taxes we already pay are supposed to be doing?

Your taxes are used to subsidize, enable, and incentivize their criminal lifestyle.

The article is slightly inaccurate. The fee will be collected from property owners, not businesses. That doesn’t
mean it won’t get passed on to tenants of course. But it seems like less ‘bad street behavior’ should lead to
increased business?

Some of those business also own their own property so it’s not completely inaccurate

Hey Business Owner. Your business is too nice to have all this crime and filth around you.
For a modest fee we could be friends and make all these things go away.
Was that City of Portland or Tony Soprano?

It really sounds like we need a needle deposit. 10¢ per needle.

Considering The bottle recycling rate is almost 100%, I’m sure this would work,but needles are a little
more hazardous to go digging around for

jmt1974 •7y ago
Don't worry, most of the people who would recycle needles know how to handle them or are already
carrying something worse

... unarmed security officers patrol the area on foot or by bike to monitor goings-oCn,r ewaitthe eyes out for
aggressive panhandling, public drinking or suspected drug deals
Last I heard, there were members like Hardesty who were against these districts (because security guards are
bad or something). Anyone know the voting inclinations of Councilors?

Central Eastside
"The Portland City Council is slated to approve creation of the Central Eastside district Wednesday. If it does,
the city would begin assessing a fee on businesses between Interstate 84 and the Ross Island Bridge and the
Willamette River to Southeast 12th Avenue to pay for the new services."
The district measures 'central' as Powell to 84 and the river out to 12th. No wonder people think Portland
stops at 82nd. Gateway should be renamed "Central Eastside".

I think the "central" here refers to its placement north-south, not east-west.

IceFoilHat •7y ago
I always that it was reference to bring near the center of the city.

You might want to look at a map to see how far into NE 84 goes from
Willamette River to Southeast 12th Avenue
and isn't that odd they said "Southeast" and not just "East"?

Looks like it's there's about 3.5 miles from 12th Ave and I-84 to NE Columbia Blvd and 3.2 miles
from 12th and Powell to the Milwaukie city limit. Seems even enough to me.
and isn't that odd they said "Southeast" and not just "East"?
I guess...

you aren't even trying to do a decent troll at this point. there's no way you actually think
anything you wrote is relevant to what the article said.

What are you even talking about? I'm just saying that the zone they describe fits the
description of "Central Eastside" because 1) it's east of the river and 2) more or less central
in terms of north-south. That's it. I'm not talking about anything else in the article. Not
sure why that's so hard for you to grasp. You can disagree if you want, but pretty much
everybody else understands what "Central Eastside" refers to in Portland.

2) more or less central in terms of north-south.
You never looked at a map. Not once. 36 blocks south and 2 blocks north is not
'CENTRAL'. Your nick is a troll, you obviously weren't ever interested in actual
conversation. You continue to think 84 is somehow 36 blocks into the north side of
east Portland and refuse to look at a map. You're a ruse and a waste of time.

I don't like the crime, but I can't be the only one that likes the grit in the inner eastside? It's just about all that
Portland has.
