I'd love to see the silicon forest become the lithium forest. We've already got a few energy storage companies
in town. And renewables aren't just hardware, software is as, or more, important.

There is no truly clean energy. Turbines do kill birds, solar panels can involve toxic chemicals such as polyvinyl
chloride and cadmium and sometimes are installed over deserts or fields, hydro dams create reservoirs in
rivers. In some areas, biofuel is credited as carbon neutral but it causes trees to be harvested to burn as fuel.
but they definitely are superior to coal
