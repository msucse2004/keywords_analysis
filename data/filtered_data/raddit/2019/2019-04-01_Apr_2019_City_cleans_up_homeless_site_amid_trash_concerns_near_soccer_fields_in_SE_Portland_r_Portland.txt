“The city also says while it’s not a crime to be homeless, none of its more than 200 parks and natural areas
are designed for people to live there.” No, it’s not. It’s a crime to let mentally ill people decide if they want
treatment or not and if they decline to leave them rot on the sidewalk in their filth. It’s also a crime to litter
and harass people that live nearby with constant noise. The real crime is not handling this situation for years
and then pretend to care about a homeless persons rights when all you care for is not raising enough taxes to
deal with it.

it's aint about money chief... it's about dealing with the drug problem, be we can't be honest about that
can we?
*edit: just so we're all on the same page - here's a link to Portlands point in time count -
http://ahomeforeveryone.net/point-in-time-dashboard, in 2015 it was 3800 it dropped in 2017 and
rebounded in 2019 but the overall trend has been an increase thats lower than the increase in our
population and that INCLUDING over 1/3 of the population that migrated to the city since 2015
we budgeted 31m but spent closer to 84m in 2017 on homeless services
https://katu.com/news/local/were-spending-more-money-than-ever-on-homelessness-but-where-is-
that-cash-going
we're adding a 1% gross income tax to high earners expected to raise 250m. you could literally put every
one of those 4,100 homeless in a luxury condo, with a continuously stocked fridge for that kind of
money.. that 60,000 PER PERSON, I don't even make that much and I pay taxes... and you know what..
there will be MORE homeless the next year
we do NOT have a funding problem, we have a TOLERANCE problem

Don’t really know what you want to say with this comment. With what resources other than money
would you propose to fund law enforcement, addiction treatment and rehabilitation programs?

R3dditingAtW0rk •6y ago •Edited 6y ago
we don't more funding for law enforcement, we simply need to enforce the laws we have an not
keep giving excuses..
nationally we are known for being an easy target, so homeless move here to have easy access to
everything they want with minimal consequences..

So what are your plans for law enforcement to do with homeless people and addicts? Put
them into cells they don’t have? And after they done their time? Also your numbers are
interesting and all but not nearly enough to make a difference: cost estimate Pdx homeless
ww But yeah, I think this problem won’t be solved in this thread. I just honestly believe that
America should be able to solve this situation as any other developed country: with social
programs that help fight addiction, encourage self-sustenance and adequate housing,
preferably housing first approaches. But thats just what I think.

actually enforce the laws on the books, doesn't require more money, we have budget, we
don't have applicants willing to work in portland. It requires the city to come to grips with
their relationship with the PPD and for the DA to actually prosecute property crimes.
we don't need to make homelessness a crime, simple stolen property enforcement, illict
drug possession, dealing, trespassing, and various other property crimes could address
the majority of our problems
after they're done in jail? well hopefully their time in prison was enough to break their
addiciton, but who knows, it's up to them
yes this doesn't solve mental illness, that's.. well.. honestly.. who knows how to deal with
that.. not me... but it's not a money issue either
housing first doesn't work with drug addiction and mental illness
btw, your citation from 2018 of 590 to 650m number is over 10 years not a single year
which I quoted, oh and by the way.. they got that money in a bond measure.. the full
650m and what good was it? not much, we just attracted more to the state
now metro wants 250m a year.. 'cause that'll help... no plan, no law enforcement.. just
wishful thinking and recklessly spending everyone's money

I'm assuming the fields in question are those at the Eastside Timbers and Thorns Sports Complex at 4710 SE
174th Ave, Portland, OR 97236. However, I didn't see it mentioned anywhere in the actual article. Lazy
journalism.

Once again. We suck. Fucking bums ruining the City and no one seems to want to enforce the law.

The homeless camp aka bike chop shop near gateway area has been there for over a year and has grown to
over a dozen tents, nothing has been done to address this. I see it reported many times in the homeless
reporter app but nothing has been done.

I've literally reported that site every day for like 6 months. Still there. As are many others I, and
presumably many others , have reported. It's almost as though I've reported so much that they see my
username and ignore me at this point. But I will continue to report it and all the others so it's at least on
record. The record of their inaction.

We need more landlord laws passed, that will solve this issue.
