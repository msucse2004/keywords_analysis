"Pollution in the area has been deemed the responsibility of more than 100 different entities including the
Port of Portland, Union Pacific Railroad Co. and Chevron USA."

Yeah, but I’m pretty sure the problems of the working class are because of immigrants and abortions and
—I don’t know—let’s say Medicare.

Well, maybe by 2040 we’ll finally stop paying the Portland Harbor Superfund charge on our water/sewer bills.

Most of the cleanup is Monitored Natural Recovery (MNR) which means they aren’t actually going to do
anything. They will just let it fix itself naturally. Only the worse spots are being dredged or capped. It’s
basically one of the cheapest options and a bunch of bullshit.
It’s generally safe to swim in, just don’t eat any resident fish. Anything that lives in the River year round is
going to be contaminated with PCBs, cPAHs, dioxins, and heavy metals. They do have fish consumption
guidelines established for how much you can eat per month, but I wouldn’t even bother. Too many other
sources of fish that aren’t SuperFund sites nearby.

What's down there is all the stuff from the industrial sites on both banks that was dumped into sewers
that drained directly into the river from the late 19th through the mid-20th centuries. Think of all the stuff
that was manufactured in that era, and then think of what to do with waste, by-products, runoff, etc. The
universal solution at the time was, dump it in the river.
The good/bad news is that a certain amount of that stuff is stuck in the sediment at the bottom of the
river. That's good news because if it stays put, it doesn't enter the ecosystem (well, not too much), and
bad news because, well, it's toxic, and not entirely isolated -- it will slowly enter the ecosystem anyway.
The possible solutions are dredging and capping. Capping just means dumping a million tons of gravel to
cover up the toxic stuff. That's kind of unsatisfying, but dredging isn't any better -- it would stir up the
stuff, releasing more into the ecosystem, and then when you remove the sediment, where do you put it?
Now you have to make some other place toxic.
