Clean Energy Corridor: I see things both ways, what are people's thoughts?

Copying my comment that I made on this topic in previous post about this:
First, energy grids aren't really restricted by political/state borders. Multiple companies, energy sources,
infrastructure and demand makes it a somewhat amorphous, interwoven, complex "thing". So while the
energy the corridor will carry is for Mass and to help them meet their clean energy goals, there's nuance in
there. Nuance that I'm not intelligent enough to convey. But if you go to iso-ne.com/ you can get some good
info.
Second, for reasons you'll see below, I'm against the corridor. I signed the petition to get it on the ballot and
will be voting against it in November. You and others may disagree with my takes. Listen to both sides. Make
an informed decision.
So, why am I against it?
I don't believe it will produce or provide more clean power.
With all apologies to COVID-19, I think climate change is the single biggest threat to our existence. So on the
surface, it seems this project would be a good thing. But the power produced by Hydro-Quebec (the
company who will produce then energy for the corridor) is already being sent to New England through other
lines. I have seen nothing that shows, proves or stipulates that by building this corridor, HQ will produce
more clean power than it currently does. In fact, the way the contracts and deal is currently set up, HQ can
actually send less clean power our way than they currently do. For this reason,the Attorney General of Mass
actually filed suit against the deal saying it undermined the whole purpose of it in the first place.
It seems no one is really sure if it will reduce greenhouse emissions.
The Maine House voted against a bill that would require study to determine the impact on greenhouse gases
of the new corridor. And when the Maine Public Utility Commission approved the project, they said there was
"reason to believe greenhouse gas emission reductions could result from the project, but acknowledged that
there is no definition of what constitutes a public benefit." To me, using terms like "reason to believe" and

"could" aren't exactly definitive. I also have issue with granting a permit to a project because it has a "public

benefit" when there isn't even a definition of what "public benefit" means. Create
While the public benefit may be dubious, the benefit to CMP and Hydro-Quebec is very certain.
If completed, CMP is estimated to profit $60 million per year and Hydro Quebec $200 million per year. Maybe
I'm just jaded, but I think that may have some reason why they want to get this thing built so badly.
Meanwhile, Mainers gets very little.
CMP ratepayers will get $190 million in rate discounts over 40 years. That's about $4.75 million/year. Divide
that among CMP's 600k customers, and you save about $8/year. That's of course before inflation (which will
occur over 40 years) and CMP rate hikes (which they're already doing).
Beyond that, the job creation numbers they throw around are temporary (the project's website touts "1,600
during construction" but no mention of permanent, quality paying ones).
The $15 million over 5 years for EV charging, $15 over 5 years for broadband and the $15 million over 8 years
for heat pumps is paltry when compare to the corporate profits.
Add to all of that, a majority of the towns that the corridor's construction will physically impact are against it.
The Maine Natural Resources Council Opposes it.
The NRCM has been around for 60 years and when it comes to issues on the environment, wildlife protection
and conservation (things I personally support), I trust them. So when they oppose it, I'm inclined to side with
them.
Fuck CMP.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em .

Thank you for an impressive rundown of the issues. My approach was basically the same as yours: if there
would be a net change from dirty to clean energy I might support it, but I’ve seen no special evidence
that that would happen. I do know CMP has been awful. And the crumbs they’ve thrown in to
compensate the ratepayers are just that, crumbs.

minus maybe the last portion, could you make a unique post about this come 1st week november in
r/maine maybe? I feel like it could benefit a wider swath of people to see it.

Yep there's a lot of money being spent convincing us to "see things both ways" but that's still a solid no from
me dawg

All are invited to a free webinar with impacted indigenous leaders John Gonzalez and Dawn Neptune Adams
plus Forest Ecology Network director Jonathan Carter on Wed at 5pm EDT. We will review some of the many
reasons to oppose the CMP corridor, including research by Dr. Brad Hager, climate scientist at MIT, who
found mega dams produce a larger carbon footprint than other forms of generating electricity. This is
because so much methane is produced when large areas are flooded (like, the size of Vermont) and the
vegetation dies. Not to mention the carbon sequestering trees that would be cut down to run the corridor
through the Maine woods. This informational webinar is being offered US Senate candidate Lisa Savage.

If the power was coming to Maine I would be 100% for it. Why would we ever want to chop down a bunch of
trees and destroy the land to help out Massachusetts?

I feel like I don’t have enough information to make a decision, but I’m leaning again against CMP and its
parent company just because I don’t want to reward them for their recent billing shenanigans which still
haven’t been resolved.

The main thing I keep going back to is all the money they are dumping into ads. If it were really a good thing,
they wouldn’t need to spend so much on trying to convince us all that it’s good.
