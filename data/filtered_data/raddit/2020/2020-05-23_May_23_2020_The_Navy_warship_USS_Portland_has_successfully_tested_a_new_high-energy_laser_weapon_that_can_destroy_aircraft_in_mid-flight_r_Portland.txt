Coeur* d'Alene. If you can't spell it, we certainly aren't going to just let you take it.

You spelled it wrong, there's no * in Coeur d'Alene.

I mean 150KW is pretty cool, sure. But what if we found a way to crank it up to 1.21 JiggaWatts?!?

What, are you trying to send our enemies back in time? Do you want a terminator? Because that's
how you get a terminator.

Was this laser by chance made by Coffman Excavation?

Lasers were proven to be the most passive aggressive weapon The Navy could develop.

I wonder if this was made in Vancouver? 🤔

Shhhh.... No one mentions that company makes lasers for the DoD.

Nah. This is a solid state laser made by a company in San Diego. It’s been out and in use for a few years
now. nLight does fiber lasers, which are different in ways I can’t pretend to understand.

The laser weapon system mounted aboard the USS Portland, successfully intercepted and disabled an aerial
drone aircraft.
The US tests that come amid high tensions in the Indo-Pacific assume much significance as the US appears to
have sent a message across to China.
