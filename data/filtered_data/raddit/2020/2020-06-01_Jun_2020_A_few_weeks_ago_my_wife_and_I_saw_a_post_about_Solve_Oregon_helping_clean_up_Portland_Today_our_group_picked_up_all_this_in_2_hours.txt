Has the city considered putting a drop box at every campsite? Seems easier than having private citizens do
the city's job.

Yeah, that would solve a lot of this. But it's also awesome that Solve is doing all this.

This isn’t the city’s job. It’s the job of the fucking litterbugs to stop littering.

These aren’t litterbugs, these are homeless people without cooking or laundry facilities. They throw
away clothes when they get dirty. They eat packaged food.
When folks can’t take care of themselves, society has to do it for them. Telling a mentally ill addict to
just behave obviously doesn’t work.

This is very naive and it speaks volumes to the different reality people have concocted in their
heads, about this situation and others.
The amount of debris, the scattered distribution of debris, and also the random/hoarding types of
items found at camp sites should be an indication that some/many in these campsites have
people living there with some form of underlying issue other than not having a home: mental
health, substance abuse or both.

In order to solve the problem, we must first define the problem. We're explaining away so many

people by painting them victims of the housing market, and the populationCs roefa hteomeless are far
more layered than that.
I don't necessarily believe the majority of those in homeless campsites are intentionally littering,
but you need a reality check if you don't think there are people at these sites who don't give a
fuck about their impact, whether by mental capacity, drugs or both, and aren't just collecting trash
and throwing it around recklessly. It's happening, you just need to open your mind a bit.
But it's 2021, so please make up a narrative to support your political beliefs.

Picking up their detritus is not taking of them, it’s taking care of the rest of us. Actually taking care
of the homeless and the addicted would look much different.
And it’s ingenuous to blame the homeless for all this trash. I see people throwing shit out their
cars every day.

Growing up in Chicago, where the city provided garbage service as a public utility, I never saw
large accumulations of trash. This whole mess is an artifact of for-profit trash collection.

The Oregonian recently did a series on how fragmented waste collection is here

I'm all on board with a streamlined public service for trash collection, but Chicago and
Illinois are totally fucked debt-wise. Not sure they're the best example.

Metro has a bag program where they give out bags to the homeless and will pick up when called. KOIN
story
Central City Concern also has a program where some formerly homeless people who check on campers
and pick up garbage. See also

Protesting
That's great and all, but sorta ridiculous that we have the highest income tax rate in the US (higher than New
York!) and yet have to clean our own streets?

I agree. I love to see people taking pride in their city and cleaning it up, but most of this trash never
should have needed to be cleaned up, and it will just get all shitty again in short order anyway.

Woo hoo, keeping portland cleaner!!
And if you’re unable to attend the clean up events, but still want to help :
Donate Advertising to Solve - Contact Dan Daly 971-346-2708 or email dan@solveoregon.org - special
programs coordinator
Why advertising? Solve currently spends $400,000+ of your $1,700,000+ donation dollars on advertising -
if you’re a manager/owner of an advertising company - if you can’t give your time/labor - why not give
your services ?
Solve also accepts supplies/bags/equipment - are you a local business owner wanting to partner with a
great local clean up organization? Solve currently receives empty grain bags from local brewerie(s) - does
your business have similar supplies or relevant equipment that you can give?
Contact Monica 971-346-2702 or email monica@solveoregon.org - sustainability coordinator

Liability. They don’t want to get sued if you hurt yourself.
