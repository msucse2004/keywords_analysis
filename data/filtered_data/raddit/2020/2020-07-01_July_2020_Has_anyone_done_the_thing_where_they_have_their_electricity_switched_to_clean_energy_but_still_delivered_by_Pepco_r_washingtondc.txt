Has anyone done the thing where they have their electricity switched to clean energy
but still delivered by Pepco?
[Discussion]
I keep getting things in the mail to switch to renewable energy provided by Clean Choice but delivered by Pepco.
Has anyone done this? If so, how has it worked out? Has your bill noticeably gone up?

Clean Choice is a 3rd party supplier of energy. DC has a deregulated energy market so you can choose to
purchase your energy form 3rd party suppliers. You will continue to get your bill from Pepco, but the supply
portion (electrons) will be supplied by Cleanchoice. The transmission/distribution portion will still go to Pepco
as they own the lines that bring you the power. Cleanchoice will match your usage with RECs which are the
tracking instrument for all renewable energy. In general suppliers are not a scam, but Cleanchoice itself is a
shitty coompany with bad prices.

This . Lots of misinformation in all the other comments. It still has to go through pepco because of T&D
but third party ensures you are paying for clean energy (delivered electrons could be from anytime
because they don't care about nothing except physics)

As someone who's never use a service like this, I'm not familiar how this works. Would it be correct to say
that the 3rd party isn't really giving you electricity from those renewable sources, per se, but that they just
pump that electricity into the grid at large and Pepco produces a few kwh less per month? It wouldn't be
like your house is actually powered by renewable energy right?
Edit: Thanks for responses. I had a few clarifying questions, but since I'm getting downvoted for asking
about a topic that I'm not well-versed in, I guess there's no point. Oh well. I appreciate those of you who

So the issue is that once electrons are pumped into the grid they are all mixed up and there is no way
to separate the clean electrons from the dirty ones. Unless you have solar panels on your roof that are
behind the meter, you are always getting power produced by a mix of sources. When you buy from a
clean energy supplier they buy your power from a mix of generators and they also buy Renewable
Energy Certificates (RECs) on your behalf. RECs are the trading a tracking mechanism for renewable
energy. Every time a megawatt hour of renewable energy produced, say from a wind farm, a REC is
also produced. The REC represents all of the clean aspects of the power - it splits the electrons from
the environmental benefits and gives separate monetary value to the environmental benefits. So
when you buy energy from a 3rd party supplier you are paying for RECs and that money goes to the
clean energy generator developers encouraging the development of future clean energy products. So
by purchasing RECs you are using renewable energy, but not technically those electrons, because it is
impossible to know which electrons you are using unless they are being generated on your own
property behind the meter.

Yes. Almost certainly. All electricity is ultimately just “pumped into the grid”. But the difference would
be if the third party provider was paying a generator for a bundled product (electricity +
environmental attributes) in region or just Texas Wind Renewable Energh Credits. Unless they are
specifically touting their PJM renewable generation, they are just buying RECs from Texas to cover the
electricity they sell.
And I would also note that PEPCO isn’t actually generating electricity, they just run the transmission
system that delivers power generated in the PJM market as a whole.

Why not do it??

Same. arcadia has been great for me and I think the billing re renewable energy is interesting to see
each month. Would recommend

What was the difference in your bill after you switched?

My bill stayed approximately the same in the low $20s range for about 125kwh or less. I should note
that we didn't elect to pay for 100% alternative, just the default 50%. I imagine if you went 100% the
difference would be a few dollars higher.

I'd be extremely cautious about making the switch to Clean Choice. A few of their reps were door-knocking in
my neighborhood last year, and as part of their pitch, they wanted me to talk to "their boss" about some of
my Pepco account information. The catch? When talking to "their boss", I wasn't "allowed" to mention that
the reps were there with me or ask any questions.
For some reason, I went ahead and got on the phone, but as soon as I asked if Clean Choice required a
financial commitment on my part (and before sharing any information myself), the "boss" hung up on me and
the reps got extremely uncomfortable. At this point, I told them I wasn't interested, and they kinda-sorta
acted like I'd figured them out and the scam was up.
While I can't confirm that they're a scam myself, the way each of their reps acted, not to mention the
information they requested from me, certainly led me to think they were. I'd recommend doing some of your
own research, but I steered clear.

We googled the kw/h prices, and it’s definitely more expensive.

Not sure but one of their letters to me said FINAL NOTICE and I thought that was kind of
sketchy/manipulative wording so I'm not doing it lol.

Same. Out of sheer principal I'll never give money to a company that uses such shady tactics

Yeah, their tactics are horrible. I never felt compelled to switch.

I'm late to the game but when I was living in NoMa with roommates and I wasn't in charge of the PepCo
account, CleanChoice energy would send me notices and I freaked out because of sketchy wording on
these letters. I thought I'd accidentally opened up a PepCo account somehow.

There are other green providers that don't annoy the shit out of you/act scammy/may be a scam. I use
Arcadia, I pay more but they only buy from green sources and I'm fine with paying more to not kill the world.
Also, is there a way to get on a do not mail list? I get those mailings from clean choice.and I don't want them.

How much more would you say your bill went up by? I’d be happy to pay 10% more but if it’s like 50%
more I’m not sure I could swing it.

It's been a while since I checked - if I remember I'll get the exact going rate for the mwh or whatever
the proper units are this weekend.

We do through clean currents. It’s more expensive, for sure, but the world is on fire so... 🤷🏽‍♀️

Aren't utilities legally compelled to source a portion of their generation from clean sources? I'd always
assumed Clean Choice was a scam to get you to pay more for meeting their legal requirement.

My bill had stayed the same or gone down. Nothing changes with your Pepco at all. You won’t have to do
anything different!

I’ve not used that company in particular but have used others in the past without noticing a difference. Your
Pepco bill arrives the same as usual. If you look at the whole pdf of the bill, you can see what money went to
Pepco and what went to the other company.
There are several providers that do this b of you’re interested in switching to renewable energy, here is a list

Yes I got signed up without me knowing it. Predatory scamming is there specialty. Then you call the service
department and they traded put you wanna even pay plan. Stay away from clean energy at all costs. They will
rip you off!
