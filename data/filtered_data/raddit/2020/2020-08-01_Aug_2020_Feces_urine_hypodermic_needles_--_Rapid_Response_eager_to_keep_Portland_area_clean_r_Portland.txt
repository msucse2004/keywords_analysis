Hamel says while not all of them come from homeless camps, they deal with about five tons of used
needles every month.

I learned from this sub recently that a local sample of about a hundred used needles averaged out to 2.654

grams per unit. Five tons is 4,535,923.7 grams. That's apparently 1,709,089.56 spent syriCnrgeeast ewhich, divided
across a 30-day month, comes out to finding 55,131 a day, on average. That's fucking astounding.

To say Portland has a “drug problem” would be an understatement.

That's apparently 1,709,089.56 spent syringes which, divided across a 30-day month, comes out to
finding 55,131 a day, on average. That's fucking astounding.
This also gives some insight into what percentage of homeless people are shooting drugs:
1. There are 14,000 homeless people in Portland. If 100% of them are shooting drugs, that works out to
3.92 injections per day.
2. There are 14,000 homeless people in Portland. If 10% of them are shooting drugs, that works out to
39.2 injections per day.
If you do the math, it implies that the majority of the homeless are shooting drugs. It might not be 90%, it
might not be 80%, but it's definitely higher than 50%.

Go check out the needle exchange outreach van where you'll see a mountain of cases of syringes. Each
case has 500 syringes. Each case is bigger than a 12 pack of soda. They give out something like 7 million
syringes annually and they fudge their numbers on the quantity returned, so 1.7 million being picked up
could be within the ballpark.
I know they give out 80 syringes for a sharps bin that holds 55 or so.. which means 25 goes unaccounted
for. They dispense something like 7 million a year. 31% of 7 million is 2.19 million. Others like Parks, Metro
RID, Clean & Safe, neighbors and business owners pick up a fair deal too.

The corner of Marine Drive and 122nd Street needs their help... bad! It's covered in trash and has been

They are cleaning that as we speak. The guy living here is clearly a hoarder.
He's likely impossible to house and would destroy any dwelling you put him in.

I wonder if it was the same guy that was on the other side of marine for a while last year. That place
was a mess, too!

Who could have guessed that handing out free needles to irresponsible people could lead to litter?

Been wanting Trimet to take care of their property and clean up the SE Tacoma stop on the Orange Line
forever. They spent all this money on landscaping but it's completely trashed.

Powell was looking so nice after these guys came through recently. I've noticed more camps being cleared
out lately. Has there been an increase all over town, or just the areas I've been in recently?
