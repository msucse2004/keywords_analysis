Putting a rooftop garden on top of a yoga studio has virtually nothing to do with climate change. But the
committee ranked the yoga studio higher than a truly meaningful proposal to provide energy-efficient, ductless
heat-pump units to low-income and community of color populations.
It's frightening when Steve Novick is a voice of reason.
Pro tip: don't approve projects that don't save any energy, and read like Portlandia scripts.

Actually the law passed by voters includes community agriculture.
The combination of energy and agriculture projects was created to get support from nonprofits. As a
result, Portlander's voted for it, and most big retailers collect the tax directly from the customers.
I agree with Novick. Especially the lack of measurement of effectiveness. It is a lot more effective to
expand community garden programs or even start urban farms.

Don't greenroofs reduce heat gain, and thus energy consumption of buildings?
The yoga studio example I recall reading about was about studying about growing food....something else
with some buzz words and a safe space.

I'm debating a grant submission for only buying local organic food.

It meets the mark by the letter of the law.

Remember to say that you will "create a safe space for LGBTQ2SIA, BIPOC, and those in recovery", like the
yoga studio did.

I loved that one campaign ad from Novick back whenever that was, but aside from that he kinda just seems
like a huge jerk.
Well, maybe not huge, but you know what I mean.

I’ve known Novick since I was a kid, and, while he is in no way suited for public office, he is actually a
super nice guy.

Novick is extremely smart. He was not able to control his snark in public. That was amplified by the media
to create drama. Reddit criticizing snark is a new concept!

Portland- where it really pays to be nonprofit.
