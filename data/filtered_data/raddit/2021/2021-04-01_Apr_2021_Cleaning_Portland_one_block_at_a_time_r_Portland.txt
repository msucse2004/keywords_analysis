I used to bitch about the mess until I started cleaning it up with Solve. Sure beats bitching and bit by bit the
city is looking tidier + I've met a lot of really cool people!

I haven't done a Solve event yet, but my wife bought me a trash grabber for Christmas and I've been
using it on my street. Feels good.

Yep, I love doing little trash walks around my neighborhood. Amazing how quickly you can fill up part
of a standard size trash bag. Found an (empty) box for an anal dildo with gemstone last week!

Now if we could just SOLVE the issue that is the trash source, that would be great.

""Portland has the reputation as one of the most trashed cities in America now. It’s heartbreaking,” said one
of the trained volunteers, Carole."

Several thoughts:
1. It isn't the citizenry's job to go clean up the mess, and Ted Wheeler's tone deaf post promoting SOLVE is
the worst. These are civic duties that should already be covered by our taxes.
2. In order to make the civic duty clean and easy, the city needs to pay the private trash haulers (WM,
Heiberg) to place dumpsters at places where people live, i.e. near to where the mess piles up. Next to
freeways, near the springwater, etc. When people have zero resources for cleaning up, they of course
leave the debris of their lives wherever they are. If there was a nearby dumpster, most of the camps
would look fairly clean.
The cost to the city of providing those dumpster ($200/month for a full sized commercial dumpster) is still
less than the gas, time and effort of SOLVE's volunteers.

Let's think bigger and pick up more garbage with a city dumpster on every block this summer!

Oregon City
There used to be a common insult, stated with disgusted tone, and it was "Litterbug"
If you threw trash on the ground in Oregon, children would mock you, and adults would give the trash back
to you.
As people from KS, MO, TX, NY, NJ, MA, and FL began to move here for the City "Brand," they brought their
habit of shitbaggetry and littering, along with demanding that pedestrians stop having the right of way, and
that people stop saying "Hi!" when passing on the street.
You want less litter? Demand that transplants stop making Oregon look like the place they left; call them out!
Call them OUT

I still shout this at my friends whenever they accidentally drop something outside.

This is so amazing to see this kind of volunteer support coming together, it's something this city really
needed after 2020.
