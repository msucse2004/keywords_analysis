If you give something to someone and then they later litter that item do you feel personally responsible?
Has anyone known someone or have you littered or dumped waste and had any legal consequences / fines?
Just wondering
Here's another article about Portland trash: https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2021/04/taking-ownership-

Epic fail, City of Portland. This isn't a thing majority of cities are dealing with despite the gaslighting attempt
by people on here, "it's happening everywhere."
I'm still thinking about this lawsuit idea I have: The city's policies are violating existing environmental laws.
edit: And ADA laws.

Some people I know were at a park downtown walking their dog and a police officer warned them that
there was an aggressive homeless man down by the water, but they weren't going to do anything about
it. They ended up getting beaten by the man pretty badly and now they're suing the city for it. I'm curious
how it's going to work out. Eta an article about it.

Yeah, make sure the concrete in front of your home isn't heaving 1/2" or the city's enforcement will be
after you with thousands of dollars in repair, but if you have a homeless camper blocking an entire
sidewalk -- the city is magically absent.
This is not how you run a city.

Not sure how you're getting that take. From the article
The city’s Homeless and Urban Camping Impact Reduction Program estimates it will need 18 to 24
months to bring the growing waste problem under control once it resumes regular camp
removals, budget documents show. City officials don’t have a firm timeline for when that ramp up
will occur
And
The city, however, is not planning to spend significantly more in next year’s budget than the
current one to clean them up. Documents show the Office of Management and Finance, which
oversees the clean-ups, requested $6.49 million next fiscal year for the homeless camping
program — a 2.3% increase from its current budget
As the weather gets nicer and the homeless migration patterns start up again, I believe the problem will
get worse before it gets better.

It does seem like people of Portland metro want homelessness, garbage, graffiti, drugs and violence based on
the measures they vote for and the candidates they elect for city, regional, county and state leadership roles.
Just sayin.

It's essentially an infinite problem. Evict the homess, clean up their shit (literally) and while you're doing that,
they just set up camp somewhere else and are fucking that area over.
Lather, rinse, repeat.

Start quoting costs, not time to complete. That might raise some eyebrows. The area around the Columbia
Slough must be so contaminated. EPA superfund liability anyone?

Maybe we should do more to keep people from being homeless?

Surely_you_joke_MF •5y ago
There's a lot we could do to help make it easier for them to transition out of homelessness. It's hard to
interview for a job when you can't shower, dress nicely, and leave all your stuff somewhere safe while you
take care of that. It helps your health a lot if you can eat decently and get a good night's sleep. The city
made a small start in that direction by making porta-bathrooms and sanitation stations more available.

Transition Projects also provides some of those basic services. Having ID and paperwork is another
barrier.

Surely_you_joke_MF •5y ago
Who provided those two Thunderdome type structures for the organized camps west of Water St
and north of Hawthorne? j/k
I am particularly concerned that the barriers you mentioned also may be keeping them from
participating in elections. If we want to have a functioning democracy, we need to have 80%+ or
even 85%+ voter participation.

If we want to have a functioning democracy, we need to have 80%+ or even 85%+
voter participation.
For that we need multiple-choice "approval" voting, plus citizen-funded (with tax dollars)
campaigns
2
Surely_you_joke_MF •5y ago
For that matter, we need all elections and election advertising to be 100% funded from
taxes, with no private money allowed in politics. Who else is in on this?
1
rosecitytransit •5y ago
The issue is court rulings dictating that advertising for a campaign is speech

Surely_you_joke_MF •5y ago
Add that to the list of things that needs fixing. Because a handful of super-rich can
spend vast amounts to sway elections in unjust proportion to their number as a
proportion of society.

What does this question mean?
What can "we do to keep people from being homeless?"

"We" basically legalized drugs in this town and created safe zones to take them. "We" encouraged camps
Skip to main content
by stopping sweeps. "We" stiffled development with bureaucracy. "We" faught againCsrte aWteapato and now
watch it sit essentially empty. "We" passed a 250 million dollar homeless services tax. "We" have done
nothing but make Portland a destination for homeless.
I've read varying numbers but it is safe to say approximately half of the homeless in this city came here
already homeless.
When did their poor choices become our responsibility? True compassion is empowing these people and
we have the resources to do that. Instead we create policy that magnifies and normalizes their horrific
situation.
What we need to do is provide opportunities that also hold them accountable and if they don't take them
we provide them with a one way bus ticket out of town. There is nothing wrong with having pride and
standards.

myarmymyarmyandme •5y ago
The day you start handing out one way bus tickets, the mayors of other cities are gonna be waiting at
the other end to give em bus tickets right back. What a pointless waste of money.

noposlow •5y ago
Well then we should get to work sending people back because I can tell you its been happening
to Seattle, Portland, and SF for years. What would be your suggestion? Incarceration? This seems
like a much more expensive option. Or would you just continue with the status quo of zero
standards zero accountability? We now have 250 million reasons a year that leave no excuses for
homeless encampments rife with drug use and mental illness to be strewn across the city. This is
just my idea but I'm willing to listen to yours.

myarmymyarmyandme •5y ago
It all depends on what the goal is - if your goal is to make homeless people leave / stay away,
then hostile architecture, police harassment and mass incarceration are sensible policies,
albeit very expensive ones. The governments role in these policies is to make the lives of poor
people worse.
If your goal is to create a clean and pleasant city, public sanitation and litter collection are
probably the most cost effective. The governments job in the policies is to make the lives of
Portlanders better
If your goal is to improve the lives of people, then providing people with housing, rehab, and
job training is what you want. The governments job is to make the lives of poor people better.
Ultimately, some mix of the last two is probably better

Agreed, but we have to be open to the reality that not all are open to the third option.
When they make this decision my only point is that to avoid option one (which I feel is
inhumane) we offer them option four, one way bus ticket.

myarmymyarmyandme •5y ago
Just moving the problem around doesn’t do anything - if Portland buses homeless
people to San Diego, then San Diego faces the same problem as us, and sends them
back. If you want to put them somewhere and legally prevent them from coming
back, that’s prison.
1
noposlow •5y ago
I said nothing about legally preventing their return. There has to be expectations, I
can't will not deviate from this stance. But I dont believe in anarchy.

noposlow •5y ago
It isn't my concern where they decide to continue their lifestyle. The point is if they refuse the
services present to help them and make the choice to live outside acceptable societal standards
they can do so in a less compassionate community that will allow such behavior. Again i firmly
believe we do not have the responsibility to own their plight rather the responsibility not to
enable an already struggling population.
