NE
TIL what tranche means:
a portion of something, especially money.
"they released the first tranche of the loan"

Its a French word. Usually used in context of bread - a slice of bread.

I don't particularly like how this program was designed. At least initially, the money should go towards city
bureaus doing the bare minimum instead of non-profits. We badly need more tree coverage in East Portland
and we badly need universal sidewalks city wide.

I would love to see some reports on who and where this money is going to end up. There is no plan. Just a
big bucket of money. I wonder how we could spend $100M to move people from mud-filled, disgusting
camps to more humane shelters with a roof and actual facilities. We could clean up the entire city with that
money.

So in other words we're doing absolutely fucking nothing and just trying to make ourselves look good to
cover up the fact Oregon is the whitest state in America.

OK. I need to ask. Why would the state or city need to "cover up the fact Oregon is the whitest state in
America?" First off, that is not true. At least 8 other states have us beat on that metric. And second, why
would a city or state try and false image their demographics?
The City of Portland tries to make itself look good for the champagne progressives, for the urban
planners, for the tourists. This has nothing to do with shifting the optics on our racial demographics and
definitely not about our racial inequities.
Still, I think this is a step in the right direction. Climate change is going to be a bigger asshole than
homelessness, racial inequities, and internet sniping all combined so we should start somewhere and not
bitch about it.
