Here are the opening paragraphs:
"Portland City Council will consider approving an accelerated funding timeline Wednesday for a new program
to protect vulnerable Portlanders during the next heatwave. According to the Portland Clean Energy Fund
(PCEF), the city’s voter-approved eco-energy fund which is presenting the request to council, the accelerated
timeline is essential to distributing the program’s first round of heat-mitigating tools to homeowners and
renters this summer."
"This new PCEF program, called the Heat Response Program, was one of PCEF’s responses to the historic heat
wave in June that killed over 60 people in Multnomah County."
"Most of the people who died lived alone and didn’t have access to air conditioning. The program directs a
portion of PCEF’s annual funding—raised through a small tax on large retailers in the Portland area—to
purchase and install 15,000 portable heat pumps in households occupied by priority populations, like low-
income Portlanders, seniors, and people of color, over the next five years. While heat pumps can be installed
into a house to both heat and cool the space, PCEF is opting for portable heat pumps so they can serve
vulnerable renters and homeowners equally."

so they want to give electric units to people who probably cant afford to run them? Sweet

As opposed to what other type of cooling units?
If the choice is dying of heat stroke or an unaffordable bill they can maybe get assistance with later,
seems like an easy choice.

The bigger problem is some of the buildings they live in can't support high wattage appliances
running in every room. Not enough amperage.

And use portland clean energy fund. . . If these are standard window units, there is no clean energy
aspect to this at all. Unless these units are heatpumps than all for it.

Well, while this is undoubtedly good news overall, I am puzzled as to why "people of color" would be a
"priority population". Surely the city does not believe that some races are more deserving than others of
being given the means to survive a potentially deadly heatwave?
The elderly of any race who cannot afford to purchase their own units should be the priority. There's no
justification for adding an element of racism to a program like this.

You do realize this whole, "Portland is so white" is dying, right? You have to be really blind to not see
that the city is filled with all kinds of colors of people. It's become cliche at this point to act like
Portland only has white people and white people get the best treatment in Oregon.
My best friend since I was a teen is black. When he visits me in Oregon he gets treated better than I
do in public. Why? Maybe white guilt, IDK. I just know that this has become less about reality/equality
and more about feelings.

That's actually more what my snide comment was getting at. We fall all over ourselves around
here to demonstrate how not-racist we are.

The demographic info on the Wikipedia page doesn't really support the notion that Portland is
trending away from being overwhelmingly white.

It only matters if they get sued for it, and who would want to be the plaintiff for a suit like that in this
town? You'd get death threats.

Surely you are mistaken. Clearly there are some historical injustices and equity issues to sort out with
regards to heat wave survival.
And, what the hell is a "Heat Pump" is this some sort of eco-friendly air conditioner? And say the city
purchases these and installs them in the homes of people who are poor, BIPOC, elderly, etc and then the
individual choses not to use it? Doesn't know how to use it? Uses it improperly? Is the city/county then
responsible for their death?

Are they shoring up the power grid, too? Won't matter how many AC units people have if the power drops.

Our grid can more than handle this. Portlands grid was set up for way more heavy use and industry than
we have now.

They are helping people go solar. More people go solar at home, less demand on the grid. Less outages.
There are things happening that help this problem.

This will be sweet. They can then pawn them for meth.

It's kind of interesting to note that the PCEF is using money to purchase units that actually exacerbate climate
change if they're given to people who had nothing before. While energy efficient heat pumps are better than
air conditioning and other heating sources, they still use power and their refrigerant (if leaks) is a major GHG
source.
While I totally understand people deserve quality home living spaces, I am somewhat concerned about the
corollary equation that as humans have cooled and heated our indoor environments with devices, the more
we've warmed the climate.
I guess my comment is, why are we not planting more trees and designing our streets and communities to
allow for them to grow properly as a first-step solution? I sometimes hear maintenance costs for trees, but
who's going to maintain these heat pumps now?
