Springe Water Corridor Clean Up
This Saturday 1/29/22 I will be conducting a clean-up of the beach front that is closest to SE 4th ave and SE Ivon
St. What I am asking for, is like minded people that want to make a difference by cleaning up our waterfront , to
come forward. I myself am tired by walking this area and seeing liter every witchway. I want to bring the power
back to the people of the city, I will be conducting cleanup projects through the upcoming months. My main goal
for yhe end of January and the rest of February is to focus on the portion of the spring water corridor that meets
Portland from Selwood. I am asking for people who are willing to help me clean up the trash that attacks the shore
of our river. I have talked to the people who are now staying at the location I want to clean. They are welcome to
the idea of outside help and are willing to help. I personally believe that a joint effort to clean our space with those
who share it is the right step in making Portland "Green again". This is the first step in a larger plan. If you feel like
this cause calls to you please contact me through this post, and we can share contact information. I want to build
this project. I need like minded people to make it grow. Thank you for reading and POWER TO THE PEOPLE !!!

Have you thought of contacting SOLVE and coordinate with them?
