The subject of this article is the ideal recipient for this type of program, and if the program were solely
directed towards these types of energy retrofits, subsidizing non-car transportation, and other actually
beneficial-to-the-climate results, that would be fantastic.
But I seem to recall a number of plans/proposals for things like a rooftop yoga garden where people could
equitably sun their butthole or whatever, and I really hope they keep a set of tight, measurable criteria for
spending these program dollars on things that truly reduce emissions.

I think the rooftop garden concept gets too much criticism. Could one argue putting a garden on a roof
reduce the building's energy consumption? Couldn't one argue it adds usable space to an existing
building footprint, thus saving land?
I find these types of interventions more meaningful than subsidizing poor households with heat pumps
(not that I am against the latter). Why isn't the first step to plant more trees in these neighborhoods
instead? In terms of climate change, planting trees is better than a device that allows someone to use
more energy than they were before.
This is the same kind of thinking of that if you buy an electric car you're saving the planet. I don't follow
the American thinking. We'd rather drive a car to the gym to walk on an exercise machine than integrate
exercise into everyday trips.
Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.

Paying the (small) excess cost of replacing an air conditioner with a heat pump is maybe the single
most cost-effective way of reducing emissions.
It sounds like they’re paying the full cost of the heat pump in this case, though.

the biggest issue imo with rooftop gardens is moisture control for the building, which is usually a
problem anyways

Well, if you want to go that route, building more dense housing and improving non-car
transportation would be a hell of a lot more effective overall than planting trees.
At the end of the day, this spending is constrained by the limitations of what was passed in the
statute/program, and so we're stuck deciding what is the most beneficial within that universe.

Not for cooling off and energy use related to that, which a lot of the plans have been about of
late at least. I'm not sure if the scope of it the tax measure relates to building more dense housing
or not (could be, not sure).

What do the trees do to make heating your home in the winter use less energy that's more cost
effective than replacing your furnace with a significantly cleaner and more energy efficient heat
pump?

efficient heat pump?

They won't help for heat. Often heat pumps are mentioned alongside heat domes/ heat waves
since that's where people die.
It's not a zero-sum game. I am not against heat pumps. Do heat pumps and trees -- but the point
I am making is simple solutions are often being overlooked. When the heat dome came last year,
there were industry types arguing every building needed AC -- few it seemed were mentioning
maybe we should reduce the urban heat island.

“With an $800,000 grant from PCEF, CEP assessed 20 houses and provided approximately $30,000 of energy
upgrades to each, depending on each house’s needs“
What an insanely inefficient use of public funds. People are being taxed to pay for people’s heat pumps in
privately owned residences. Why would you not focus grants of public projects, city owned housing, or other
initiatives that can be used by a larger group of Portlanders while still reducing emissions?

I bought a heat pump for a private residence a few years ago that was partially subsidized by the state of
Oregon. This is nothing new.

Oh man, you're head is going to explode when you hear about great work that the Energy Trust of
Oregon is doing.

Will the owner's assessed value go up $30,000 too?

Generally, no. Unusual tech has little effect on property values; people prefer what they are
comfortable with, although it can help with the right type of buyer.

technologies, reduce consumer cost over time, and provide more reliable, flexible anCdre iantferastructure
which provides benefit back to the community and reduces taxpayer dollars spent on other pieces of the
energy pipeline. we ineffectively use tons of taxpayer dollars, but IMO residential energy retrofit is not a
bad use of money. and that’s not even going into exactly what funds are used for this, how it’s allocated,
and what the actual realized cost is for the taxpayer

Neither your local or state tax money goes to this program. This is a funded by a fee assessed to large
corporations.

This is super cool. I’m excited to see what programs come out of this (that I can apply to) after they put out
the big chunk of 100mil this year.

Glad you’re so eager to waste money that isn’t yours on ill conceived projects.

Nice. I don’t think it’s the most efficient use of money, but it’s a good cause and I hope it sets a good
precedent for eco-friendly solutions and helping low income folks.

Portland Clean Energy Fund (PCEF)—a city program that uses a surcharge on major businesses to fund
green energy projects in communities most burdened by climate change
By “surcharge” they mean tax. What are they even referring to when they say “impact of climate change” and
how is there on specific people in Portland that are disproportionately affected? Why are people building
solar power in one of the most rainy cities in America? This seems like a complete and ill justified waste of
money.
