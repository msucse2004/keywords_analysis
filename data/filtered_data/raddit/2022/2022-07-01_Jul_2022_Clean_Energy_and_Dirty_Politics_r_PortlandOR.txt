Supporting the Current Thing
Yet another chapter in Portland’s self-dealing non-profits gobbling up cash under the cover of “frontline
communities”. If you read this guy’s newsletter you are bound to find something challenging in his snark. But
he speaks the truth, and his journalism is badly needed in Portland.

I don't agree with several of his hot takes on other topics but generally his assessment of the non-profit
world is something I find common ground on, most of the time.

I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Your winnings, sir.
Whotta surprise - that the politically connected organizations behind the measure turn out to be the primary
beneficiaries of the measure.
The proposal…comes six months after the city rescinded a five-year $12 million grant from this same fund to
nonprofit Diversifying Energy following an Oregonian/OregonLive investigation that documented its leader’s
extensive history of financial misdeeds and unpaid taxes.
It gets better - the committee handing out the money explicitly decided not to do background checks on
grant applicants. It was like lighting the BatSignal for fraudsters.

The writer is a want-to-be Tucker Carlson. That is not a complement, I'm not a supporter of the anti-
government narrative. But this program has design and staffing problems which can be fixed.
A rational discussion follows. The program was largely designed by Commissioner Hardesty pre- her election.
Convincing nonprofits to endorse it was her work.
The amount of money collected is probably 4x what it should be. It was a prototype campaign for a state
sales tax which the public employee unions want.
The program could have been tied to the measured energy savings system the Energy Trust of Oregon uses,
but it was not. As the article mentions, CO2 measures are lacking. The committee is not very knowledgeable
about energy or CO2, while Portland has many knowledgeable people in that profession. Let's hope the
skilled jobs produced are measured.

putting them to work at scale, would produce measurable outcomes in jobs and CO2. TChree gatoeal should be
middle income sustainable-a profession job creation. No one would argue against that.
The committee spent the first year training other nonprofits on how to apply and what they were looking for
in applications. They designed the outcome they produced. Better quality grants need more quality
applications and a better committee.

You've been a stalwart defender of this program every time it's come up.
But you're seemingly unable to understand a core concern here: this didn't fail. The corruption isn't seen
as a problem.
You're saying, "This should be fixed" but the kleptocratic city and nonprofits fundamentally don't see it
that way - they're saying this program works great.
The intention was to funnel money to shitbag nonprofits who exist only to further the political goals of
those in power. This goal has fuckall to do with climate change, racial justice, the colors in the rainbow,
Christ on the cross, or anything else.
Why would ANYONE be so stupid as to want this fixed? It's working perfectly as intended from the get
go, exactly as these groups envisioned it is exactly as it works now.
The only problem is that you haven't realized you were being duped.

I don't disagree with your analysis. So far it has primarily been an about $100M a year slush fund with
no objective measurement. That's real money, about the same as the Metro homeless dollars sent to
Multnomah County each year. I agree it is a completely wrong funding mechanism. I agree that many
nonprofits have no goals beyond effort, good vibe press releases, and have no way to measure their
results. I think each commissioner chose a few committee members, it was the wrong mix, and the
program manager was the wrong choice.
And I agree it was designed that way by Commissioner Hardesty pre- her election.
The Energy Trust of Oregon works and is measured. PCEF is about half the budget of ETO, and about
2/3 the entire regional public utility efficiency budget which is also closely measured for results. ETO
measures the cost of energy saved by efficiency programs. It could easily be expanded to the cost of
carbon emission reductions compared to an accepted social cost of carbon. Just training, then using
their labor to do a lightweight residential building inventory of every building would have
tremendous value. Another approach is to get people in their target community through certified

energy manager/auditor, PMP, agile PMP, change management, and other energy industry programs
which can cost several thousand dollars. Create
The goal should be to create well paid trade and professional jobs in energy, not to create nonprofit
administrator jobs.
I mentioned that pre- the vote on it and since.

Terrible take on heat pumps, they are way more efficient that furnaces.
