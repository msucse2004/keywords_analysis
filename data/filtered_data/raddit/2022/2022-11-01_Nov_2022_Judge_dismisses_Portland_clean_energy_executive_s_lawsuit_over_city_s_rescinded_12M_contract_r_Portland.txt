The Oregonian/OregonLive subsequently revealed that Woodley had served time in prison for
defrauding energy companies in the 1990s and later racked up millions of dollars in liens for unpaid
federal and state taxes, including an $810,000 penalty filed in early 2021.
The news outlet also found Woodley had mischaracterized and likely fabricated portions of her
professional background in her firm’s proposal to the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits
Fund. The new tax-funded program provides money to nonprofits to reduce carbon emissions, create
jobs and promote resiliency.
City staff later launched an independent review of Woodley’s work history and said they found
“concerning inconsistencies.” They were unable to verify portions of it despite contacting numerous
people she named as being familiar with the work.

I don't know which one is easier, religious tax freedom or just slapping an non-profit together and asking
the city for money. Apparently no eyebrows are being raised (well, minus the newspaper that caught it
the first time).
By the way, somewhat of a side topic but did we ever get any resolution or answers on this?

Before that cyber theft, PPS lost $2.9 million to hackers in 2019. That's 4.3 million dollars lost since
2019. You would think the city might have added additional safeguards to protect taxpayer funds but
nope. The employees responsible (after the city treasury warned them the transaction looked
fraudulent) were told to stay home for a few days as punishment.

Wow. Didn't know about this one. Is there just zero accountability?

Why the @#$%^ does liar and fraudster Linda Woodley still have a $198k contract with the city? She should
have been permanently banned for fabricating large parts of her application for that $12 million dollar
contract.
