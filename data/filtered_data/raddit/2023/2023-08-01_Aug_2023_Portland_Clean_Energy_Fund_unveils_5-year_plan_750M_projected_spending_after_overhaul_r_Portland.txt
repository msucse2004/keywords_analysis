Not sure if they published this on their website yet but the programs they intend to fund are pretty
interesting. I don’t get all of them, but this is first of its kind and intended to also be a model for other cities
which is nice bc it would be great to see Portland leading on something these days.

$50 million toward "supporting youth-led climate initiative".... That's going to buy a shit ton of pizza.

Just some context for those who didn't read the article: it's actually $50 million "to make schools more
resilient, which could include infrastructure upgrades, energy-efficient retrofits and supporting youth-led
climate initiatives."

The second strategic plan would immediately begin planting trees in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods
to increase tree canopy. The program estimates it will plant at least 25,000 trees in public and private
property and provide maintenance.
This is great. I just wish more of the money was going to sidewalks in SW and East Portland.

I do have to agree. There is a stark difference between the sidewalks in downtown PDX vs SW and East
Portland.

Hopefully that will be better spent than the contract with Linda Woodley's Diversifying Energy.

When I heard this on the radio today, I couldn't help but thinking: "wouldn't it be better to invest $750M into
earthquake preparedness?"
I feel like we put band aids on things when the Big One is just going lay waste to everything. Like, spend the
money to decommission the oil tanks and keep our rivers from being turned into toxic sludge / burning
inferno, etc.

While I can see the arguments for earthquake preparedness, and absolutely do agree that it's necessary,
the issue is that it is not directly related to energy upgrades and electrification in homes. There have been
conversations about broadening PCEF's work to include aspects such as earthquake preparedness, roofs,
siding, and various other aspects; however, who knows where those will go.
With PCEF funds, part of the goal is to swap from oil tanks to heat pumps, so oil tanks are getting
decommissioned, so that solves part of the problem you propose here.

Those are kind of related. If we use less fossil fuels, then maybe those tanks become unnecessary. We're a
long way from that happening, though, and I wouldn't be opposed to requiring seismic retrofits on as
many of the tanks that ought to have it now.
We need to do both, basically. We're going to pay the price of climate change one way or another, and
we're going to experience the consequences of an earthquake at some unknown time in the future one
way or another.

what is the budget of the clean energy fund before this increase?

It's a flat tax rate. They spend what they collect.

You can lookup the budget on the city website.
