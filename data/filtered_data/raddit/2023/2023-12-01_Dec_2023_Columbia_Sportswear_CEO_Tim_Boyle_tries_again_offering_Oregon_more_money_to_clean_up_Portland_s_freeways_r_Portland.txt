It’s really sad seeing parts of Portland cleaned up just to get trashed again a week later

What if the city stopped giving the homeless stuff to trash the city with?
https://www.opb.org/article/2022/12/08/multnomah-county-purchased-more-than-22000-tents-for-

Or, you know, actually forced them into shelters or somewhere away from the streets.
Maybe enforcing the law and actually punishing people would do some good around here.

Honestly I don’t know what the answer is and I doubt it’s simple but people need to learn the
difference between helping and enabling. Portland is enabling homelessness and it’s at the expense
of everyone else.

Nice-Pomegranate833 •2y ago
The countries in Europe that effectively deal with homelessness offer a lot of services, but all of
them use a "carrot and stick" approach. People don't value things if you just hand it to them with
zero obligation. One example would be needle exchanges. The exchange portion is essential
because that requires addicts to bring back the used needle in order to obtain a new one.
Without that part you end up with needles scattered all over the city.

The answer is long term and costly.
Shelters help, but they don’t fix the issue. I’m not arguing against them, I advocate for more
shelters, but that’s just to treat the downstream effects of what got them there in the first place.

My family’s farm has a stretch of public road on it that’s often used by local traffic. It gets absolutely
trashed on the regular and not by homeless people. It’s regular assholes in cars who dump bags,
cups, cigarettes, all kinds of garbage.
Blaming every last thing on homeless people helps those assholes get away with it. They’ll continue to
do it as long as folks are looking the other way.

This could be stopped if the city put out dumpsters in selected neighborhoods for
large items, free to dispose. The issue is the city is more driven on income from
dropping things off at the dump than actually getting rid of street trash.
12
Gregory_Appleseed •2y ago
After having to use the city dump and seeing how long it took and how expesive it
was for just a few things, I can understand why people and business chuck it
where they think no one's is looking or lay out a "free pile" on the street. I don't
condone it, but that's what happens when you are only given little to no
alternatives. If the garbage doesn't get picked up or disposed of properly it just
spreads around and gets harder to clean up.
Everywhere else I've lived had some kind of "free day" every month where you
could dispose of a few large things at nothing extra. There's no reason we couldn't
do something similar here, and it prevents "illegal trash" from causing public or
environmental damages.

Drivers can be assholes and dump plenty of litter, but the large mounds of tents, tarps, broken

It's not surprising that your family's farm would have a stretch of road that gets covered in litter
from drivers, and while that is shitty, it is in no way indicative of what the city is like and where the
trash people here encounter daily is coming from. There are huge camps along the freeway that
get cleaned up and become disgusting sites again almost immediately with just mounds of
garbage from camps full of hoarders.

No, start by forcing people into shelters or move on. There will never be "enough shelter" for

This is something I just can’t understand. I moved from a compassionless state where the police

and take all their stuff. I personally watched them brutalize houseless people more than once for zero
reason. So I was excited to move to a state where there wasn’t so much government sanctioned
brutality. I didn’t care if there was a lot of homeless people here. I realize that they have to live

somewhere and I don’t want to be a NIMBY. However, I was not prepared for the amount of
Skip to main content
government tax dollars that would be going towards sustaining them and keepiCnrge athteeir joblessness
going. Went from watching them almost get intentionally murdered by taking their stuff away right
before snow storms when there was not enough shelters. To watching the government hand out
shelters constantly any time they feel like walking away from a tent and going to a different part of
the city.
Honestly there was a lot of money towards combatting the houseless in my last state. Police overtime
hours etc. Here in Portland there’s an even larger industry keeping them fed and sheltered. I guess I
could see keeping a registry and each human is handed so much stuff per year. I’m not heartless. But
it’s hard watching the government shove all this money out a window on people who aren’t
contributing and get a bigger pass than working folks.
Am I crazy or entitled for these thoughts?

DacMon •2y ago
You have to get them in permanent secure homes (like, with an address and a private kitchen and
bathroom) or (if they are not capable enough for that) rehab and treatment centers.
And you assign each of them a caseworker who can help them find the services they need.
And you have to offer plenty of rehabilitation and education.
This works. It almost entirely eliminated homelessness in Salt Lake City when they tried it from
about 2005-2015. And it saved a ton of money compared to allowing them to remain homeless.
The program ended and now they have a homeless problem similar to Portland.

This is such an important point, and something we've really lost track of. We don't need homelessness to

ILoveNewDart •2y ago
This is the crux of the argument that is infuriatingly left unaddressed in so many of these articles. How
many of these will there be before someone starts hammering our politicians, over and over, with
questions about why our taxes continue to translate to pitiful performance in new mental health, drug
treatment, and shelter beds.
I understand govt will move slower than industry, but it at least needs to be incentivized to expedite
construction or deliver on policy promises. I’m tired of “oh yeah that new tax that we said would fund
an additional 1000 shelter beds and low-income housing units in 3 years, will actually be more like
300 in 8 years.”
It always comes back to these band-aid solutions that still cost astronomical amounts that do nothing
for the core causes. We need to limit investment companies from buying huge swathes of housing,
driving prices up, and putting more people on the street. Along with increasing shelter bed and
drug/mental health treatment capacity. Until we have that, we literally cannot ban public camping.

The problem isn't money, it's a lack of people and the way the ballot measure was written.

the housing fund has to be spent on housing per the measure that created it. Can't just
spend it on whatever.

First I've heard that SHS had built-in allocations that were problematic; one of the
objections to the ballot measure was the lack of specifics on spending and

county from building the clearly needed facilities while working on the staffing
portion.

To start: use the fucking available funds to start building some treatment centers. Fast track
development, open up zoning restrictions for open office spaces, get creative.
Secondly, stop with the free handouts for anyone that wasn't an OR resident prior to experiencing
homelessness. Period. No more free tents. No more free meals. If you're not from the state, gtfo.
Finally, and you wont like this, start being harsh. Especially on zombie campers (impound
immediately, fines to recover, etc.) Basically make it a pain in the ass to be in the "homeless as a
lifestyle" zombie RV crowd.
Make it shitty to return. The reality is: there are a fuckton of homeless that want to be on the streets,
that don't want jobs, that don't want shelter, that want to live this lifestyle. They found a vagabond
life forum and Portland is the place to park your camper/tent, get access to all the drugs you want,
and enjoy a relatively tolerant police/community.
Is it all, even half? Nope, but there's enough that are making it hell for the rest.

Attorney here. For better or for worse, there's a very long line of Supreme Court precedent that
says a state cannot condition the receipt of public benefits on the length of tenure, so this is
simply a non-starter, policy-wise.
What you *can* do is have wait lists, which would naturally put new transplants at the back of the
line, but you can't say "only folks who have been here for a year or more get these benefits," our
Constitution provides for freedom of movement as well as equal protection.
We could also do a lot more in terms of enforcing existing laws that would make camping less
appealing, and at least lessen the impact these folks are having on our shared public spaces.

Without getting too much into the weeds, in-state tuition has been held to be a materially

support, as attending college is a voluntary thing, whereas being in a position of poverty
is sometimes unavoidable.

Man that second demand is going to be such a nightmare to figure out how to enforce. The first
one is also a nightmare. The county controls the money and would rather give it to their cronies.
When money and proposals get made, out come the NIMBY's. Actually trying to solve
homelessness is very unpopular to those that will have to live in the general vicinity of the
shelters.
Increased harshness feels like it's coming, but it won't do a lot without carrots also in place.

I mean.... to the homeless community, more pointedly, to the vagabond community, Portland
is currently ALL carrot, and no stick.
Cheap drugs, mild weather, generous services comparatively speaking, and next to no
enforcement.
What I think you mean, and I agree with, is we can't be all punishment, no support. We need
to actually build drug abuse support infrastructure, we need better services, and enough
temporary housing options to justify treating those who refuse services more harshly.

How about we return to weekly trash pick up?
9
slumberjack_jesus •2y ago
A while I ago I read an interview with someone from Metro (?) and this was actually a serious reason for
so much of our trash. Biweekly pickup was intended to get us to recycle more; in practice it means lots of
people run out of space in their garbage bin and toss it put it in their recycling or green bins instead,
defeating the entire purpose. When those bins fill up as well, trash gets dumped illegally elsewhere.
Another issue they cited was that there's no easy way for people to get rid of bulky items (furniture,
mattresses, etc.), so they get dumped illegally, too. The obvious place for lots of people to do it is by
camps because 1) they're usually already out of site and 2) are full of garbage anyway. Camps are
certainly a source of our garbage problem, but it sounds like a lot of people are opportunistic and use
them to dump stuff they can't or won't take to the dump themselves.

It. Is. BAFFLING…that we don’t prioritize the cleaning up of garbage along our most visible places.

Having a high income tax is effectively taxing the rich. Basically, If you don’t have much income and don’t
have property, your tax burden should be very low here. If you make between $200k-600k, you probably pay
more on taxes here than you would in any other city in the US. This would be many middle aged college
educated dual income families (eg a cop married to a nurse; engineer married to a teacher). This is
exacerbated by the fact that moving across the river to Washington has the opposite tax structure. For
someone moving from Washington making $200k would need to have their salary jump to $224k just take
home the same paycheck

My fiancée and I make just over 200k per year and recently moved across the river.
That extra 24k we get to keep is life changing. Like, my roof needed replacing and I had the money to pay
it.
Plus I’m only 15 minutes from downtown Portland as long as it’s not rush hour traffic on the bridge.
Don’t think I’ll ever move back. There’s just no reason to.

Vancouver
an even more interesting question, is - why is the CEO of a company paying to clean up trash along Oregon's
freeways? (yes, CEOs and rich people should pay their fair share +, but he shouldn't be initating it due to the
state not doing it)

Littering creates jobs and is good for the economy and the environment. If I toss my $6 organic kombucha
bottle out the window, that .10 will recirculate through the community many times. I can feel good knowing

my overpriced artisanal beverage container will be picked up by a houseless person looking to supplement
their fentanyl budget. That person in theory will then get the deposit on the bottle, takeC trheaatt emoney and go
buy dope and spray paint. They will tag up a freeway sign, causing a rich ceo to miss their turn and want to
pay to clean up the roadways. The state also wants to do this…This will amount to millions of dollars in funds
pumped into the economy via the county homeless industrial complex and transportation/urban planning
grifter money tunnel.

Pride of ownership. Never give up. I’m with Boyle, trash & graffiti need to be constantly cleaned and
removed. Lay down and they’ve taken over.
