Portland Clean Energy Fund 101 Work Session
Government
portland.gov Open
This morning from 9:30 to 11:30am there will be a Portland City Council work session on PCEF reform, the 1% tax
on large businesses in Portland that has generated huge surpluses of funds sitting unused or to questionable
projects with no accountability — like Street Roots new headquarters — while the city is in a budget crisis and
can’t fulfill basic needs.
PCEF supporters from local nonprofits (who receive money from the fund) will be there in force wearing green to
express support for the status quo.

I think the activists might be in a bit over their head given that there's political consensus that this is a waste
to be handing out free money to organizations like Street Roots.
This funding is obviously going to be pillaged by the City to support our General Fund. Same with the rest of
the specifically appointed funds - this is frankly obvious and predictable to anyone with an ounce of
knowledge on Oregon's history of misallocating dollars away from specific purposes to general purposes.
So dipshit hapless voters enacted a 1% Sales Tax. We're going to drop the illusion it has fuckall to do with
climate change - it never did in the first place - and certainly won't once the city is done diddling it.
Next order of business is how to increase the Sales Tax.

If it’s considered a waste to be handing out political organizations like Street Roots, I haven’t heard anyone

articulate that in any position of power. I guess no one cares since like you say they’re just eyeing the big pot
of money to share with the identity-based nonprofits and call it all “climate justice”.

This is exactly the issue with Portland. The local government virtue signals by passing taxes, and they are
either uninterested or too incompetent to utilize them. We get the same old shit, plus the benefits of higher
cost of living in the form of higher prices passed on from these businesses. Stop voting for these idiots and
their taxes.
