Seems the mayor is spearheading the litigation , while the DA is protecting the reporter.
The mayor has very rich donors, the others do not.

It just never stops does it? Portland is at a level of corruption most people have no idea.
Get some of these forensic accountants to start looking at stuff and see what they find.
Self enrichment has been the motivation for city leadership for a long time

administering the program costs 3x more than the revenue it generates)

These are businesses that PAID the tax, not that avoided the tax, so I'm not seeing how it's shaming. Also,
the tax took in more than $180 million in FY2023. Its administrative costs are a small portion of that
amount (around $5M or something in that neighorhood last time I checked), not 3x.

From the article: "Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt disagreed in a Jan. 8 ruling. His
office determined that Oregon’s public records law superseded the city’s confidentiality provision and
that exemptions to the state law did not apply to information sought by the reporter so long as portions of
the records were released separately, according to a copy of the ruling.

energy tax as well as the money each owed but “in such a format as to not associate anCy rienadtievidual business
name with any dollar amount,” the ruling reads.
Along with Portland officials, some of the state’s largest business lobbying groups have decried the
decision and backed the city’s move to reverse it, arguing that disclosing the information would not only
violate taxpayer privacy but could also have other troubling ramifications."
Some people are confused about who are the good guys and the bad guys.
This should clear things up.

So like... can anyone file a public records request to see how much I paid the city for the Preschool-For-All
tax last year? Or how much I paid in Oregon taxes? I don't get why this would be public information.

No_Cat_No_Cradle •2y ago
Yah I’m a bit torn here myself cuz I get both sides. But it’s not like there’s a bright line that says all tax
data should be private - you can sure as hell look up what I paid in property tax last year. And though
not a tax you can FOIA people’s city water bills too.

dataturd •2y ago
MAX Yellow Line
Yeah, that's a good point. It seems like something directly tied to income (or revenue, in this case)
wouldn't be publicly available, but idk.
4
No_Cat_No_Cradle •2y ago
Agreed, at minimum i can appreciate Schmidt’s caveat that the city shouldn’t reveal what each
business paid, that’d get into some potentially revealing info (though so does revealing
whether a business is over the threshold in some cases I’m sure)
5
dataturd •2y ago
MAX Yellow Line
Yeah, it still makes sales revenue info of private businesses open to the public (although
like you said, not exact numbers). It just seems like that's not the government's
information to give out in the first place.
I think I'm just still bitter about Equifax losing all my fucking credit info when I didn't opt
into it in the first place.

Which is a good analogy because both have income thresholds. If they can see you were taxed
then they know you make $200k or more.

I wasn't even making an analogy. Can someone submit a public records request and see the
names of all people paying the Preschool for All tax? That seems like pretty sensitive information,
even if it's not an exact number.

Happydivorcecard •2y ago
The difference is that to qualify for the CES you need to be a retailer a total gross income in
excess of $1 billion AND a Portland gross income of $500,000. Most of these are going o be
publicly traded companies to begin with, but even with privately held corporations you
probably are not getting into an individual person’s tax information at that size.

LMAO, Iannarone's dopey crew already tried that and failed. Not to mention Wheeler has actually been

members of the City Council snipe at each other.

I love when people use “the adult in the room” as a form of praise like that isn’t the bare minimum
expected of any member of society. If the best thing you can say about the man is that he’s not a
child you’re truly scraping the bottom of the barrel.

The only way we will ever reform our nation's economy and get some kind of basic fairness is if ALL of our
finances are public. Yep, yours, mine, and ours.
Sunshine is the best disinfectant, so air it all out so we can see exactly what's going on. It won't be
comfortable, but it will be necessary and helpful.

Yeah I don't think we need to itemize daily expenses.
We definitely need to know all the income and assets of every person and company, and it needs to
be public. It's the only way to hold everyone accountable to following the rules and paying taxes. It's
the only way to see and stop corruption and favoritism. Do you think Clarence Thomas or Bob
Menendez could have hidden the corruption if we could see their income, assets, and who the
sources were? Do you think Enron could have happened if we could see how they were making
special entities to hide their debts from investors and regulators? Does your neighbor have a big ass
house and boat from his contractor business but claim an income that is much lower than his
lifestyle? Is he taking money under the table?
It needs to be public because then you can see what all parties are claiming, and it's much easier to
scrutinize. Other parties can help call bullshit when they know something about the situation.
If our nation actually collected the taxes which should be paid, we would have a much more robust
society. If we could see who is getting bribed and where the money comes from we might have a
chance at a fair society.
