The pandemic fucked us up. One of the things I loved about Portland is how the street artists respected each
other's work and public amenities. Now the little shits are tagging anything and everything.
To people who don't think graffiti isn't a big deal, think about your car's windshield getting tagged, or your
favorite mural being painted over. A tag sign might not seem important, but thousands add up to a lot of

I see two types of graffiti. The artistic cool things like murals and legitimate artwork, and the obscene
vandalism which is just putting your name or a bad word or something up.

Time_Turner •2y ago
The latter are called tags. Depending on the scene there's a hierarchy of graffiti and you don't cover
up the "blockbusters" or "pieces" like murals or massive letters in heavily stylized font, with tags or
lesser graffiti.
Tags are generally amatures or gang related. Sometimes they're just there to show you were there.
Publicly seen tags are shit IMO. They are fine in the bandos and hotspots where the public doesn't
really visit much or property owners abandon the place. Unfortunately it's controversial.
This video goes over it fairly well https://youtu.be/QBuiX4IDnPk?si=BfYJLAywDMhkI8ss

That's one of the tagging issues that blows my mid. Not just 405 - there are multiple signs all over
Portland that are totally covered or at least illegible. My 16 year old son just got his license and that's
all I think about when I see these things. If they don't want people spastically crossing over three
lanes to catch their exit (aside from the ones who do anyway), it might behoove them to at least fix
the signs.

It makes me embarrassed for Portland. Had my Belgian relatives over this month and they were more

Good article about this complex problem.
Seems one thing missing from the proposed solutions is a return of the police “graffiti traps”. If they’d bring
that back, along with actual penalties for the vandals, that would help.
The rest of everything needs to happen as well. Fixing this requires a multi-faceted approach.

We have very few police officers. We have less police officers today than we had 30 years ago despite
increases in population.
It's not "they aren't doing their job" it's there's literally not enough police officers. Claiming that rank
and file employees are intentionally not doing what they should do is conspiratorial. You literally have
no evidence aside from a high school belief that "Cops are bad"

Goose Hollow
The problem is interesting in Goose Hollow, where we have a constantly changing homeless population and
Lincoln High School. Both contribute to the graffiti issue in our neighborhood, but from my observations the
teenagers from the school are far more prolific. I constantly catch them tagging on/next to my apartment
building. A few weeks back, I caught a boy and girl smoking fentanyl near the back gate of our building. I
asked them to move and offered to call homeless services for them. They told me they had just gotten out of
school and one of them showed me their textbook. I was fucking floored. I've called and the school about
these doesn't take it seriously (I guess since I don't have kids that are students in their school, they don't
really care?)
To be fair, it isn't just students from Lincoln. My partner commutes to Hillsboro on Max. Sometimes his
schedule changes and he works late nights/early mornings. He has seen one specific teen on the train from
Hillsboro to Downtown several times in the last year. He gets off at Providence Park and gets right to tagging
where ever he can. My partner has pointed him out to me several times. One time he confronted the kid, and
the kid just looked at him like he was speaking an alien language, and went right back to tagging.
There are plenty of homeless folks down here who tag in this area, but it seems way less frequent. Some of
these teens seem to carry around full kits of spray paint and paint pens with them at all times. I imagine
homeless folks don't have much disposable income to dedicate to graffiti and tagging supplies.

I was walking in Cathedral Park and saw some teenagers climbing on the bridge's footing and when I circled
back around 10 minutes later there were about 20 shitty tags all over that spot. Back in the Midwest if you
got caught doing graffiti it was well known that it was treated as a felony and you were fucked (record, jobs,
etc.) so there was a huge incentive to not do it. Not to mention most people I knew who did it were creative
and had nuance where they put their tags.

People would fight laws allowing felony charges; a good middle ground could be probation and requiring
them to help clean up. Consistent enforcement would go a long way. Its likely a relatively small number of

I really hate that we can’t collectively agree that the St. Johns Bridge is off limits. It’s a historic landmark,
and one of the most iconic symbols of our city. It’s bad enough that every picnic table in Cathedral Park is
covered with low effort, low quality, aesthetically shitty tags. Maybe we could leave the bridge alone?
I’ve noticed a big uptick in graffiti in the area since the Cathedral Village apartments were built. It may be
coincidental, since graffiti in general became a city wide issue around the same time.

Watts’ firm spent five months pressure washing, scrubbing and painting, and got that number down
to 7,189. And it would have stayed that way if the city had kept its foot on the gas. But shortly after
the holidays, Portland downshifted, Watts says. Part of the problem: Wheeler and Adams parted ways
in January 2023 amid complaints that Adams belittled staff, including graffiti leaders.
This is an interesting microcosm for an issue that I think contributes to a lot of Portland's dysfunction: too
much focus on whether our officials are nice and not enough focus on whether they're effective. We can
actually judge Sam's influence here, and by the numbers, he was doing a good job. But he was mean, so out
he goes.
Nice and effective are two qualities that rarely overlap in leadership, because a big part of being a leader is
knowing when to call out when things aren't working, and often things aren't working because people aren't
doing a good job. You can present that kind of feedback nicely, but it's very easy to overshoot the mark and

The punishment for that tagger is a joke. Not even the equivalent of the cost of the damage. It should have
been full restitution, plus additional compensation which would be about double for the efforts of the
building owners, plus community service equal to the court, police and probation costs and probation. If he
misses deadlines on payment or hours, throw his ass in county for the weekend. Taggers scrawling their

I personally like a lot of the graffiti, and have a list of writers I keep an eye out for: Antsi & Naive (who seem
to be besties), Gulch & Jitsu (who seem to be friends with Antsi/Naive as well), Jazman, Kabob, Penis Girl, it's
fun to drive around and spot them, keep tabs on who is still in it, who has settled down (haven't seen a new
Antsi in awhile), where people live (Kabob seems like a SE guy).
But it's gotten completely out of hand.
There's a code among writers, or at least there used to be: don't write over someone else's writing, don't
write over a mural, don't write on private property. Abandoned buildings were up for grabs, fallow concrete
walls, underpasses, dumpsters, etc., but small businesses, houses, beautiful public spaces like the St. John's
Bridge, and definitely highway signs, were off-limits. Writing was also an art: big, bold, stylish bubble letters
that took time, skill, and coordination to pull off.
These days people just spray whatever-the-fuck in the least stylish way possible. I've seen people's wooden
yard fences sprayed, which as a carpenter makes my blood boil. Writing over other writing, ruining another
writer's piece with chicken-scratch, spraying the old Foster Outdoor building's tree mural, or the "Art Fills the
Void" mural. No respect for other artists, homeowners, anyone. Now it's just another way to say "fuck you" to
society. It speaks to a growing antisocial sentiment that seems to be pervading any and all walks of American
life. Or maybe all the people with artistic integrity have left/grown up, and the next generation of writers is
just a bunch of dickheads.
