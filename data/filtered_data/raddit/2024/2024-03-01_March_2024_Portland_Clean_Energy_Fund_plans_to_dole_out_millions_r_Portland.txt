They don't directly say it but the excess is per year. The Oregonian makes it more clear:
the program will pull in $1.3B over the next 5 years.
[Originally] The fund’s authors estimated it would raise about $30 million a year
https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2024/02/portland-clean-energy-funds-staggering-windfall-spurs-
money-grab-threatens-climate-justice-ambitions.html
so far has awarded $155 million to more than 80 local nonprofits.
New allocation plan is here: https://www.portland.gov/rubio/news/2023/12/13/rubio-proposes-additional-
climate-investments-clean-energy-funds
Approved projects: https://www.portland.gov/bps/cleanenergy/grant-committee/documents/bureau-pcef-

Notably Includes $100M for street tree maintenance and replacement.

This is the problem with our city and governance. We vote in a ballot measure, it generates more revenue
than anticipated and instead of quickening or expanding rollout of said program the politicians shuffle the
extra money into the general fund.
I’d rather see things like free/discounted insulation programs, solar power, EV charging stations, discounts on
EV’s and electric bikes, more bike infrastructure, more trees, more parks…
Rather than “climate proofing the Keller auditorium.” How many needy people - the people PCEF was
supposed to target - can afford tickets to the fucking ballet?

As usual we're massively overthinking things with layers and layers of non-profit grants. A stupid simple
rebate program for energy improvements was all we needed. It doesn't get the cool ribbon cuttings that
politicians want, but it's an efficient way to meet the spirit of the measure. Rebates for insulation, solar,
windows, heat furnances/water heaters. Done.

It also wouldn’t allow a large chunk of the money to get pissed away on redundant non-profit
infrastructure. Oh wait that might be intentional?

discounts on EV’s and electric bikes
Ebikes especially. Some of the latest research suggests that electric bikes are taking a bigger bite out of
overall carbon emissions than EVs (at least with the current economics where EVs are priced for middle to
high income folks) , Portland could really sieze an opportunity to promote them here since we're alreay so
pro-bike.

Because our over-all tax structure is quite fucked and there’s general need things to do, But we definitely
don’t want to pay for things or alter the structure issues.

I mean, if you have an Oregon Trail Card you can get tickets for $5 through Arts for All. This is one of the
things the Arts Tax pays for I think. Many theater shows and the ballet start at ~$30. Not super cheap, but
not super out of reach either.
But I agree with your general point. I think we should be using the extra money to expand Biketown and
bring the cost down substantially. We could double our investment in street trees from $100 million to
$200 million. We could complete the 2030 Bike Master plan. We could be investing in additional Trimet
service in the City Limits.

I honestly don't think it's a bad idea to get creative or looser with the definition of what this gets spent
on. I do think the majority of the fund should go to the exact things you mention above, but I think there
is some sort of misguided notion that we're going to like electrify the whole city with it or something.
While that would be cool, it isn't really a city-level task to take on in many ways.

I think the name of the game for the next few years is anything that is shovel-ready, or that a majority of

You mean remodeling people's entire homes while they do heating and cooling efficiency measures?

Or maybe tax credits/returns to anyone who paid into it? I’m not sure if that ever happens but that would
be nice!

I’d rather see the city maintain its facilities so we don’t have to replace them wholesale at massive
expense (see PP&R).

Put it toward lowering people's energy bills.

Helping add insulation and/or replacing baseboard heat with heat pumps is the correct form of help to
give for lowering people's bills. Just giving them a break on the cost of electricity removes the incentive
to improve energy efficiency.

Yeah, the best way to combat emissions is to encourage people to use more emissions-causing power!

our area is very unique in that we have a many renewable energy resources (dams, wind in the
eastern columbia) that operate at a fraction of their usual load due to lack of demand.

as with politics in general, power isn't inherently bad, you have to take into account where it
originates and what it is used for. Create

Wouldn't lowering people's power bills run counter to the goal of lowering energy use/impact?

Years ago there was a program in Oregon that helped you cover the cost of implementing energy saving
upgrades in your home. There was no down payment and you paid off the cost of the upgrades via your PGE
bill. It was pretty awesome - it's how I ended up getting rid of my oil furnace and properly insulate my
basement. It linked me with good contractors and helped me to feel like I got the best deal possible and used
all of the government rebates available to me. It was a 30 year loan for the upgrades so the minimum
monthly payments didn't add a ton to my regular electric bill. There was no penalty to pay it off early if you
so chose. I'd love if they do something like this again.
