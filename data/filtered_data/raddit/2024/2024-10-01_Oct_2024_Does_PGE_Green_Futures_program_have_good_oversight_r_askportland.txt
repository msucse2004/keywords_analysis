Does PGE Green Futures program have good oversight?
Looking For
I've signed up for the Green Futures program in the past, but after the rate hikes I'm hesitant to volunteer more
money to PGE. Does anyone know if the Green Futures program does what it says and subsidies renewable
energy?

What do you mean by good oversight? Are you wondering if PGE uses the money for its intended purpose
and you’re worried they’re just pocketing the money?
Rest assured, the money is being used for its intended purpose of subsidizing green energy. 1. They have an
army of CPA’s who make sure the books are correct and all money is properly accounted for and used
correctly. 2. They get audited every year to make sure the books are correct. 3. They have an internal audit
department who is independent of the c-suite. They also ensure that money is being used correctly.
Now, if you’re questing how useful it is to voluntarily give money through the Green Future program is a valid
question. Oregon is already requiring PGE to switch to all renewable energy sources as well as being able to
support an all electric future. The capital investments needed to make this happen is the major driver behind
the rate increases. So you’re already paying for a bunch of green initiatives through rate increases rates, and
you’ll continue to pay for more green initiatives in the future as rates go up to cover more new green
infrastructure. The question is if you want to donate more money to help even more with the green energy

transition by donating money through the Green Futures program, or if you are happy knowing that you are
paying for green energy transitions through your electricity rate. Create
