Realized.

Big news: you spoke up and it
worked!
The Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ) just paused the air permitting
process for Zenith Energy and canceled two
public hearings scheduled for Nov. 19 and
Dec. 4.

We know Zenith Energy has a history of violations and misleading regulators. So we
decided to answer the question: just how many violations has Zenith committed?
The answer is outrageous. Turns out, violations appear to be part of Zenith’s
business model. Since arriving in Portland, Zenith has racked up roughly 20
violations from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ)! Together,
these violations tell the story of a fossil fuel company that has been out of
compliance nearly the entire time it has been operating in Portland, a company that
has misled regulators to obtain permits to expand operations, a company that cannot
be trusted.
How did this happen? Despite DEQ’s mission to “be a leader in restoring,
maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon’s air, land and water,” DEQ showed
a very high tolerance for Zenith’s violations. DEQ identified roughly 20 violations—
some lasting as long as 4 years! Some of these violations are less serious, but others
have the potential to significantly harm public health, safety, and the environment.
What is consistent, unfortunately, is DEQ’s unwillingness to assess meaningful
penalties to deter Zenith’s future rule breaking.
Perhaps the most shocking violation we discovered is that Zenith illegally expanded
its fossil fuel operations! In April 2021, Zenith added new infrastructure and
connected to an additional marine loading dock at McCall Oil. After illegally hooking
up, Zenith began using the dock to transport fossil fuels—at the same time Zenith
was assuring regulators that any new infrastructure would be used exclusively to
handle “renewable” fuels.
Zenith’s illegal use of the McCall dock went undetected by DEQ for two and a half
years. But instead of issuing a penalty, DEQ is now proposing to reward Zenith by
including the illegally accessed dock in Zenith’s new air permit.
Clearly, Zenith is bad news. The good news is that we can stop it. It’s up to us to
demand that DEQ do the right thing and deny the air permit!
Timeline Summary Of Violations And
Lies
Late 2017 and 2018: Zenith takes
possession of the facility and begins
handling hazardous tar sands
oil without notifying regulators or the
public.
1. Late 2018 – Present: Zenith submitted a Notice of Construction to DEQ to
construct 32 new rail car off-loading stations, assuring DEQ that the new
infrastructure would result in “no new throughput.” Instead, Zenith
significantly increased throughput each year and plans to continue
significantly increasing throughput in the future.
2. 2018: Zenith failed to pay fees to the City of Portland on time.
3. November 2018 – December 2022: Zenith failed to perform the required
initial test of its marine vapor combustion unit (MVCU) to ensure it was
effectively capturing air pollution.
4. January 2018 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to submit the required
Notice of Approved Construction Completion to DEQ within 30 days after
completing construction of the MVCU.
5. October 4, 2018 (Warning letter issued): Zenith stored volatile liquid
products in fixed roof storage tank #67, instead of using a floating-roof tank for
better pollution control.
6. October 4, 2018 (Warning letter issued): Zenith stored volatile liquid
products in fixed roof storage tank #74, instead of using a floating-roof tank for
better pollution control.
7. October 4, 2018 (Warning letter issued): Zenith stored volatile liquid
products in fixed roof storage tank #93, instead of using a floating-roof tank
for better pollution control.
8. 2019: Zenith failed to conduct a proper spill drill—using diesel fuel
instead of the heavier and more hazardous tar sands oil that Zenith was
currently handling.
9. 2019: Zenith failed to submit a report for tank #68 to DEQ within 15 days after
startup certifying that the tank met specifications and passed initial
inspections.
10. 2019: Zenith failed to submit a report for tank #130 to DEQ within 15 days
after startup certifying that the tank met specifications and passed initial
inspections.
11. February 2019 – September, 2020: Zenith failed to submit a Notice of
Approved Construction Completion to DEQ within 30 days after building 32
additional rail car off-loading stations.
12. March 2019: Zenith led Portland officials to believe, incorrectly, that
Zenith had stopped handling tar sands oil.
13. March 20, 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to submit a Notice of
Approved Construction Completion for tank #130 to DEQ within 30 days after
completing construction.
14. August 30, 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to submit a Notice of
Approved Construction Completion for tank #68 to DEQ within 30 days after
completing construction.
15. 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to submit a notification of the date of
construction for tank #68 to DEQ within 30 days.
16. 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to submit a notification of the date
of construction for tank #130 to DEQ within 30 days.
17. 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to notify DEQ of initial startup for
tank #68 within 15 days.
18. 2019 – February 14, 2022: Zenith failed to notify DEQ of initial startup for
tank #130 within 15 days.
19. January 2020: Columbia Riverkeeper and Willamette Riverkeeper sent a
Notice of Intent to sue Zenith for violating its Construction Stormwater
permit. In August 2021, Zenith settled and agreed to pay $115,000 to Portland
Bird Alliance in lieu of civil penalties.
20. 2022: Zenith illegally lobbied City of Portland officials for a city land use
approval that Zenith needed in order to get a Clean Air Act permit.
21. 2022 – January 2024: Zenith withheld information about plans to handle
“renewable” naphtha from the City, DEQ’s spill response team, and the
public.
22. April 2021 – March 2024): Zenith illegally expanded its fossil fuel
facility to include use of the McCall Oil dock to handle additional fossil
fuels. This illegal use went undetected by the City and DEQ for over two and a
half years!
