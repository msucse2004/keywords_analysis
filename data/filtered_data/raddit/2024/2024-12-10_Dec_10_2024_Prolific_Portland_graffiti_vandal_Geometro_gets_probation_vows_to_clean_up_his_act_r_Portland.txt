They probably caught him because like the Geo Metro, he isn't very fast.

I gotta say, that graffiti is exactly as shitty as a geo metro, so bravo to that guy for nailing the branding.

One of the Car Talk guys said the Geo Metro was one of the best cars ever made. He's right too. They
were so simple nothing failed on them.

Last 3 cylinder car in production. 50 mpg easy per gallon but going over 75, easy, as long as no hills. Or
high gravity. Or a heavy breeze. More than one person in the car. Lol. Drove that thing into the ground.
Roadtrips all over.

The Mitsubishi Mirage has a 3 cylinder engine. That bad ass fucking car is the same as the Metro. Gets
like 50mpg, but can only break 70 if you are going downhill. On a side note, my buddy in college who
was 6'5 had a metro, and loved it. He would drive home to San Diego and back to LA on a single tank
of gas with some to spare. People made fun of him, and he would just say, "you can beat me in speed,
but much like how i pleased your girlfriend last night, i win in stamina".

Our 24 Nissan Rogue has a turbo 3 cylinder, engine sounds neat!

Still_Classic3552 •1y ago
Same. Great car. I treated it like a truck. It's amazing what you can fit in a Metro. Back when gas was
high in 2012ish? people would leave notes on my car offering to buy it. Gave it to a friend and she
totalled it the next day. Smh. Took out about half a city block and she drove it home! Lol!

Ramras sentenced Saul to five years of probation, 90 hours of community service and ordered him to
pay restitution of $9,400 to the Oregon Department of Transportation, $1,000 each to the city of
Portland and Boring Bark, and a total of $775 to other property owners.
This seems appropriate. He's 23, the judge is right that he's at the perfect moment to change. I hope this is a
wake up call.

Sure has no problem targeting a massive prime real estate blank canvas downtown right behind
big pink. It’s massive… I can’t imagine someone doing that and no one taking… notice. Haaaaa…
sad pun.

Good. His tags were trash.

Tagging is the most basic form of writing your name. This would be a throwup. You're 100% correct on
trash though.

Arrest all the taggers and restitution for the clean up!

Wow, his lettering was so bad that they arrested him? Serves him right!

Yes I understand tagging is lame and most of it is ugly. But man I wish we could change other things going
on in our beautiful city. Just seems like huh 🤷🏻‍♂️, so we got a tagger! Yay! Like really?

Tacotuesday15 • 1y ago
I mean he was arrested and put on probation… seems like an appropriate response to a “lame” crime
4
Pizzledrip • 1y ago
Yeah I guess reading it in my news feed seemed like who cares I guess. Why is it even being posted
when we have so many other issue that need addressing. But lesson learned I won’t type anything
and just scroll by next time to avoid haters.

I honestly wouldn’t call concrete and asphalt as far as the eye can see “beautiful”. One of the most
calming responses I have is seeing all the grey turn into green whenever I drive from the city to the coast.
What some of you call “beautiful” is just daily eye fatigue for many.

Prolific? I drive all over and I've never seen these tags. This is some toy shit
