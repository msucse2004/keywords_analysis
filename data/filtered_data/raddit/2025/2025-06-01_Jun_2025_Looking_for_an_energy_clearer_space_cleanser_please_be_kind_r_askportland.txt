Looking for an energy clearer/space cleanser? (please be kind)
Looking For
Yes, I know this is probably the most Portland post possible. I am a skeptic, but ever since moving into my present
house, things have felt very off. Like there’s a heavy, negative presence or energy. I have a CO monitor, so it’s not
that. I’m hoping for a recommendation from anyone has been in my position & had a positive “energy clearing”
experience.

Edit: also good on you for checking the CO alarm that is important and not enough people talk about it lol
I am not gonna recommend sage smudging because if you're not Indigenous it's not going to work.
You could try burning other more appropriate herbs, mugwort is one of them.
If you have a spiritual practice, you could lean into that. I am a polytheistic pagan and part of my practice is in
honoring the land spirits and my ancestors, so I will light a candle and leave an offering of (water, alcohol,
bread, something like that generally, can be as simple as literal water) for the spirit of the house, for spirits
passing through, for the deities I venerate, and my ancestors to protect me. I will pray to have a harmonious
relationship with the spirits and firmly state that I live here now but I honor their presence.
I keep an iron railroad spike on the window closest to the door as a protective measure (I got mine at Ravens
Wing shop in Sellwood which is a local queer pagan shop with local goods and not just shit you can buy off
Amazon).
My current home is pretty clean and clear but I've lived in some creepy and "off" places for no discernable
reason. Sometimes it takes divination and multiple cleansings, offerings of incense and opening windows,
airing out the house, calling to ancestors, etc, to really clear a place out.
I don't care if people judge because frankly it is a cultural practice that goes back a long time in many
cultures and the best part is even if it means "nothing" and I'm crazy, it has a psychological effect of being
helpful.
Caveat is that I also have PTSD and that has effected my feelings of safety in homes and I also take
medication and am in therapy lol. It's a process of both medical and spiritual praxis.

You don't have to be super spiritual or knowledgeable to do this stuff but a simple acknowledgement out

loud and spiritwork is ultimately gonna be way more effective than buying sage from wChriteea tpeeople at Powell's
and then waving it around. You establish a better connection with Spirit instead of pawning that off on
burning herb, IMO.
You could also ask the folks at Ravens Wing if you go down there or you could try a botanica (there's one in
Alberta but I haven't been yet).
Hope that helps xox

if the typical cleansing doesn’t help i would recommend using a tarot deck to ask the energy
questions! sometimes whatever it is will tell you what it wants/needs to clear the air

or you can even use some homemade dousing rods if you don’t have any divination tools

White sage is the only sage to stay away from if you’re not indigenous. That’s only because it’s
endangered. People don’t own plants.

Right but I have also been told that we don't know the protocol for properly smudging regardless.
People don't own plants but ... Cultural practices can be closed and not available to everyone. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Tell me the difference between smudging and cleansing

As far as I know, I'm not sure, but that isn't the point. The point is that it's appropriative and
not our practice to do if we are not Indigenous.

I have had sage given to me and have burned it personally in the past and found it ineffective
Skip to main content
and then when I learned about the issue with sage I chose to burn someCtrheinatge else instead. It's
not hard to respect.
If you personally want to burn sage, I'm not going to stop you. This is an old argument and
I'm not the first one to have it so don't act brand new.

Maybe reach out to the folks at New Renaissance or Psychic Sister to see if they have a recommendation. It
may be better to have someone identify what/who the energy is first in order to understand how best to
cleanse the space or communicate with them.

Keep in mind if it’s a more sentient energy a cleansing may not do much.

Maybe try contacting Amy at Temple Medicine. Not sure if she does home visits, but she does amazing
energetic work.

No, it won’t clear or cleanse anything, but it will tell you if you’re being exposed to radiation from power lines,
electrical appliances, and wireless communication devices…. or “other” things
