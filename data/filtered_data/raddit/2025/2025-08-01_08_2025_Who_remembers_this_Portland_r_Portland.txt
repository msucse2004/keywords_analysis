Now look at the percentage increase over those years and compare that to average wages, that's when it

This is the only real metric that matters. Avg wages vs cost of living.
Cost is always going to go up, thats the society we live in.
What we shouldn’t have to live with is wage stagnation.

Before the rent increase rules I was living in a complete shit hole for $550 a month. Over the course of six
months the landlord who didn't live in Portland raised the rent to $1200 a month because he looked
online and saw brand new luxury units going for that amount. Clown world.

I moved here in 2013 (sorry) and paid $645/mo with WGE covered. NW 21st and Burnside.
It’s weird that was barely more than 10 years ago. Moved out in January ‘20 and was still only at $895. I
had friends who moved several times to dodge massive rent increases, while I was just in one place.

If you take the apartment prices in general across the country in 2003, adjust it for inflation, it’s not that
bad. The problem is housing, among other things, far FAR outpaced inflation somehow….

I'm asking cosa...but in general, ANY rental apartment or house is an investment. So
saying that means any owner of any apartment is greedy. And that's not right either.
1 Reply
stalkythefish •5mo ago
I was specifically speaking of buying up free-standing houses in a market where there
is an already exacerbated scarcity. There are plenty of other investment vehicles out
there which don't take something essential out of the hands of a more needy
individual.
Rental properties built as rental properties are a commercial endeavor from the get-
go. Different beast. (This includes adding a rental unit to an existing house, because
it's still a net-positive to supply.)

Are you under the impression that the rental market, and the sale market are not connected?
Owner occupancy only accounts for 58.2% of residential occupancy.
I'm talking about house flippers, who do shoddy cosmetic work and jack up the price. I'm
talking about landlords charging what the market will bear instead of what is fair. I'm talking
about the increasing number of housing units that are owned by hedge funds and other
investors. Who would rather leave units vacant that bring rent down to meet the market
where it is, because lowering rent reduced the paper value of the building or house.
My house should not be worth $700K right now, but it is. I paid $350K for it 7 years ago. This
is not a sustainable level of inflation. The reasons prices are so inflated have nothing to do
with people who want to buy homes to live in them.

SolomonGrumpy •5mo ago •Edited 5mo ago
So do you think it's greedy to sell your home for $700k or not?
Everyone thinks what other people do is greedy.
See this place? https://redf.in/wtmuII
It finally sold after being on the market for over a year. The original asking price was even
higher than the $1.27m shown in Redfin. I think it was $1.4m
But no way that neighborhood could support that price point.
So someone purchased it for $645k and completely redid the home. The same people
who did the ""Street of Dreams" home. Looks like it took over a year to complete. Let's say
for shits and giggles that the reno cost $300k (parts and labor). Maybe it will was less.
Maybe more though.
They ended up selling for $1.15m
Do you think it's fair to make $205k profit on a home after 2 years?

You skipped the entire middle paragraph, and it shows. My point is that individual
buyers who need a place to live are not the problem. I listed many of the people who
are the problem, but you paid no mind to that.

There is plenty to disagree with in your middle paragraph too, but there is only so
much Im willing to write.
Are there bad actors in the rental and home sale market? Sure. Is everyone who
transacts in the housing market greedy? No, man. Most are people just trying to
find a place to live or to make an honest living.

I used to live in The Louisa (in the pearl), 20 years ago, in a 1bd 700sqft apt. Rent was $1200 and $100/mo
for parking. (Which was expensive at the time but I was making good money and recently divorced, and
loved living there.)
I just looked up my old floor plan on their website and rent is now $1652/mo which seems really
affordable to me. And not much price inflation.

Portland’s population growth outpaced housing growth for those 2 decades as well.

Vacancy rate is ultra-low, value-to-income is really high, and it’s only gotten a little easier to build here
(despite years of electeds yakking about housing crisis).
Only real paths toward affordability are building way more housing or a whole lotta people gotta GTFO.
Sadly the latter seems more likely.

Those prices are through the roof compared to the 70s and 80s. You could get a whole house and yard for
