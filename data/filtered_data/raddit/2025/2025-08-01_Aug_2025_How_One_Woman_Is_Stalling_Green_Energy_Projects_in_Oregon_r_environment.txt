Oregon liberals, opposed to nuclear power in the 1970s, created a complex process for getting new energy
projects approved. And now, a 76-year-old activist is using this process to stall wind and solar projects.
Irene Gilbert has filed more challenges to energy projects — 15 in all, including lawsuits — than anyone in the
state, according to Oregon’s Department of Energy.
“I kind of have a reputation,” Gilbert said.
Energy infrastructure was a sore spot for Gilbert. Decades ago, a chunk of the forest she owned was
bulldozed for a transmission line. She blamed the line when she couldn’t get the timber to grow as she
wanted.
Now that she was older, she said, she wanted to give back, and she was motivated by the idea of helping
farmers and others protect their land from the government and electric companies.
“I feel like my reason for participating now is to do what I can to help these poor folks,” she said.
Critics say Oregon’s slow process for approving energy projects is one reason the state ranks near last in the
country for green energy growth despite setting a deadline to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2040. Just in the last
five years, the Oregon legislature has repeatedly rejected or watered down bills related to energy projects.
Some Oregon progressives give a nod to the bureaucracy that once mired nuclear reactors and say it’s time
to give windmills and solar panels a faster pass. Yet lawmakers have balked at meaningful changes.

Example 9000 of 70s environmental strategies not working well in the modern day.

This is pretty common across a lot of blue states. The bureaucratic red tape is abused to stall renewables
projects by their opponents.
Its why Texas is deploying renewables faster than any state. They dont give a fuck.

Isn't is fortunate then that a Executive Order to get rid of such burdensome restrictions has been made... /s

She probably thinks she’s in the right, but she’s a terrible human being and the reason we need to limit public
input on infrastructure development.

This is something the left needs to grapple with.
Every project shouldn’t have to clear referenda and universally addressed public comments and multiple
overlapping layers of environmental and historic reviews.
