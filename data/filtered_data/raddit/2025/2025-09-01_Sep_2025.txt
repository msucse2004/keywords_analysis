I hate stores that have someone checking the receipt. But I may have overreacted.
Discussion
I grew up in places where stores had bulletproof glass and supermarkets had people stopping you from exiting
without signing off on your receipt. You know, they often wear a vest (sometimes they're third-party security while
other times, they're hourly workers). Where I grew up, they were aggressive towards people who meet a certain
profile - and let's just say that profile is people who look like me.
So when I discovered more places in Portland were implementing a "Receipt Checker", I rightfully got frustrated. I
don't want to be treated like a criminal. And I was seeing them everywhere. Fred Meyers, Ross, even a thrift store.
After a full year, I'd say these receipt checkers are alright. Many times, it's been really pleasant. One guy showed
me his marker collection. One made a funny comment about my donuts. One really tough-looking gal drew cat
faces on my reciept.
I still think they shouldn't exist. And maybe the stores wish they didn't either. And maybe people on the Pacific
Northwest don't have rent-a-cop energy with sticks up their butts, compared to where I used to live.
I may have overreacted to the Receipt Checkers out there. Thanks for making it a tolerable experience.

Y’all are worried about the receipt checker and not the self checkout that uses facial recognition, records your
every action and instantly plays it back for an employee if it thinks you tried to steal something? I had one go
off on me the other day and I had no idea why. The employee said something about a bag.
Not to mention it’s my understanding those identical security stations in all the parking lots now share
information and track you.

Are you talking about the self-checkout-- which really increases shoplifting, and the stores know it, but
it's still cheaper than giving a job to a human being?
That's the part of this that really annoys me. The store has already chosen to overlook a certain level of
shoplifting as a business strategy. They still make more money. The thief gets free stuff. Who pays? Us. In
higher prices and suspicious interactions.

Costco typically does (but not always thoroughly), and back when Fry's Electronics existed they actually
did usually check the receipt.
Story about that though: My MIL was buying a bunch of Christmas gifts + random supplies there and had
a cart full of stuff, easily a couple hundred dollars worth. When she had her receipt checked, they found a
single mechanical pencil that had fallen into the cart (likely from one of their checkout displays) that
wasn't on the receipt. The guard proceeded to give her the third degree over it. Eventually she went
"Okay, fuck this" and, went straight over to returns, and returned everything.

I worked at Fry’s in Sunnyvale, Ca as LP. I was the guy greeting people (they wanted us to call out
suspicious customers coming in), checking receipts (I never cared if you said no, I was making
$12/hr), and I checked returns.
The biggest theft I had witnessed was a guy with a full cart walked out. I asked him for his receipt,
he said “I’m stealing this”. I radioed in to my manager that someone was stealing and when he
asked how I knew I said that he told me. Guy got in his car and drove off before anyone could
even do anything. I wasn’t going to 😂
That place sucked and they took advantage of anyone who was there on a work visa which was
most of my coworkers.
Randy Fry was a piece of shit. His rich son had no friends and I felt bad for him, and our store
team leader Cornelius was a fucktard who would call me a girl because I had longer hair.
Fuck. Fry’s.

Recently I asked them why they check the receipt when they have my entire shopping trip on
camera. The guy told me that they mark the receipt so when people throw it away outside of the
store a person can’t snag it out of the trash. Go into the store and pick up an item that’s on the
receipt and use the receipt to return it. Ever since then I inspect every thing before I buy it to
make sure I won’t need to return it, hand off my receipt to the checking employees and walk out.

Gross. Harassed over a, what, $2 pencil unless it was one of those crappy ones and like 89¢. Stupid

I assumed this about Costco as well: verifying there’s not an obvious discrepancy between the
quantity of items in the cart and on the receipt, confirming that multiples of pricier items are
counted correctly, and if there are more expensive items (electronics, etc.) in the cart, verifying
that those are on the receipt. Their system doesn’t seem designed to catch 100% of mistakes or
petty theft. Which is good, because it would either be super-annoying to customers to have to
wait in a long line to exit, or expensive for the company to staff enough people to check that
thoroughly without causing major delays.

Having worked at the fry’s for ever they were checking for a few things. 1st make sure the invoice
number was in the right range (there was a guy who would print his own of the 8 1/2x 11 receipts got
away with tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff took them forever to catch him in about 07, he
actually would come in buy something small to get the invoice number in the right range then go out
to his car and print a receipt for typically mac products, go back in grab them and head out). Check
for missed items/mis rang items/double charges. Back in the early 2000’s they were actually paid
commision on “catches”. Which was even more annoying for the customers. A particularly thorough
one could make pretty good money doing it actually.

They mark the receipt so they know that it’s already walked out the door. Scammers will use old
(unmarked) receipts and re-enter the store, grab an item from the receipt off the shelf, then ‘return’ it for
cash.

pastriesandprose •2mo ago
I think it’s more scammers will go in with an unmarked receipt, fill their cart back up with the same
items, and try to leave with the first receipt so they get free food. It being marked shows that they’ve
already left with that cart of food.
Returns don’t really make sense to me for the receipt marking.

It doesn't stop them from returning stuff, it's to stop them from using the same receipt to walk out of
the store twice in one day with the same items and only paying once, or from picking up discarded
receipts from the parking lot and grabbing the same items and walking out. they started asking for id
for even store credit returns and flagging you for surveillance if you are habitually returning things.

As a former hoodlum, the easiest, simplest way to steal, is to just casually walk out the door, as if you
already bought the stuff. Didn't work all the time, but did a surprising majority of the time. This was
mostly beer runs when i was a kid, but I'm sure the principle is the same with other items.
The thing someone else mentioned about marking the receipt so people don't go back in and refill their
basket with the same items makes sense too.

AFAIK the only types of places that are technically, legally allowed to check your receipt are membership
only places like Costco or Sam’s Club, because it’s part of the membership contract you sign when you
join. Any other regular grocery store type place can’t require this to be a part of the transaction. At the
point of sale, when you pay, that merchandise becomes the property of the buyer, and there’s no legal
reason for a cop or anyone else to have a look and as a citizen, there’s no legal reason to stop me from
getting to my destination once I’m finished shopping.
I’ve been stopped at Freddie’s before and was asked for my receipt and asked them to ”Do I have to?”
And Paul Blart got all pissy but said “no, but I’m supposed to look at it, it’s part of my job. But you can say
no thank you.” I said no thank you and walked out. Mall cop couldn’t do anything. If they feel the need to

I can only speak for myself, but they just let me walk by. You place the awkwardness of the interaction

My big issue with the checking is they then want to give the receipt backs to me. Before the self checkout
overhaul you would just say no Thankyou to the receipt. Now I’m required to take it to leave the store. But
then when I don’t wanna take the receipt back from security they have a freak out. You have a garbage can
right there at your feet for this issue. Once that shit makes it through the doors people just litter. I am fine
showing my receipt if they are fine to take it and dispose of it. Like a ticket taker at the fair I don’t need my

for?
I can poke my phone a few times and have whatever it is delivered to my doorstep in a few days to
weeks. I simply don't buy LEGO retail any longer, and I had been to support the local economy.

Freddie's on the rest side of Gresham tried for a short while to have a checker. I refused to stop. If they can't
pay for a clerk to ring up our purchases and force us to either wait in long lines or self check, then it's on
them not me. Think enough of us felt that because they got rid of the checker at the door.

I feel like they know it's just as silly as I/we do but they were hired to do the job.
I deeply dislike the whole process though.

It's just a show, its not like they'll actually stop someone from stealing.

These stores seem to never be able to afford more than two registers open, and self-checkout may or may
not be open, but they can afford armed security plus setting up like three different secure sections of the
store that also require a separate checkout and locking half the store behind glass.
Fine, I guess I'll submit to a full cavity search, I do need that detergent.

It takes about three seconds and I barely break my stride. Does everyone have like social anxiety to the point
they can't interact with a security guard for the barest of minimum effort?

I just ignore them. The store can't stop you from leaving after you've paid. It isn't Costco, where you signed a

I'll hand them my receipt and keep walking. I will never need to return my apples and oatmeal. If they want
the receipt so bad, they can have it.

I don't care or get worked up about it. They're just doing their job and if it stops someone from wheeling out
an entire cart full of unpaid merch, I'm fine with it..

You can just say “No thanks” and walk past them, that’s what I always do.

You are under absolutely zero obligation (Costco excluded) to produce a receipt when leaving a store
(well, if you are being accused of shoplifting, that might change the equation.
A polite "no thank you" is the correct way to resolve this situation.

Oh, I absolutely hate that. The only place it’s OK for me is Costco.
Not gonna lie I was at Portland Belmont hipster 20 years ago, but I really enjoyed shopping at the Happy
Valley Fred Meyer today where it felt healthy and happy. Wilsonville is nice too.
Oh no, I’ve become a basic middle-aged person.
