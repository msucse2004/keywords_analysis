I'm curious what you're all doing while on hold with unemployment.
Discussion
Hello fellow Portland government moochers!(/s if you need that)
Day 2 of trying to get through, 5 hours and counting on hold with unemployment today.
I'm in the middle of moving so I've been packing and cleaning all day while listening to mildly infuriating hold
music.
In the midst of mindlessly wrapping my vast collection of mason jars and Oregon pinot noir wine glasses I began
to wonder what the rest of you fine folks are finding to fill your time while teathered to your phone on multiple
hour holds with the unemployment office.
P.S. Please feel free to be as ridiculous as you like. While I am in fact packing, I'm also bored to tears and itching
for non cardboard related entertainment.
ETA: To everyone giving advice, thank you! I hope it helps the next person. I did finally get to talk to someone after
6 hrs & 23 minutes on hold.

During lockdown and initial year of pandemic I made a big band/orchestra arrangement of the hold music by
ear on my keyboard and DAW.

Thank you for the advice. Unfortunately I sent a message over a week ago and no response. I'm guessing
because it's not a simple issue.
I'm trying to dispute the start date of my benefits(not the waiting week). My first day unemployed was
10/1 but they are saying I wasn't eligible until 10/12(with 10/12 being my waiting week and payments not
starting until the following week), and I have no idea why.

greenhairymonkey •20d ago
Could be the last pay date maybe? I think you aren’t eligible while being paid by your previous
company, so if they gave like 2 weeks paid, then your actual work end date would be later.

Princess_Peachy_503 OP •20d ago

My last pay date was my last day(9/30). It's a legal requirement to pay you by the end of day
following your last day, unless you quit with less than 48 hours notice then they have 5 days to
pay you.

If you click on the owl to start a chat and put in live agent it’ll direct you to an actual person
to talk to. I only waited about 30 minutes last time to chat with a real employee and the
person ended up calling me instead of chatting since it was easier than typing it all out.

Interesting. When I had to apply a few years ago, my company put me on garden leave first,
so I couldn’t apply for a little. I do remember being told Monday was the worst day to try to
call, so perhaps better luck tomorrow?

For what it's worth, it took about 3 weeks for them to respond/fix an issue I had but when they did it
was rectified very thoroughly. They had me filling out a temporarily laid off form when I was not
temporarily laid off. I sent in my weekly forms as usual and every time I sent a message through
Frances along with it saying I've tried calling but not getting through and that I was permanently laid
off and I'm filling out the wrong form. Around the 3rd or 4th week, my form switched over to the
permanently laid off form and all my payments were in my account without having to go back and re-
fill out my previous forms.

Maybe because the unemployment benefits “clock” starts on Sundays, so your first full waiting week
didn’t start until Oct 5.
Edit: never mind, I see now that you said your waiting week starts the 12th. That makes less sense.
3 Reply
Matcolstr •20d ago
Your start date depends on when you applied for unemployment, not when you became unemployed.
So it honestly just sounds like you waited a couple weeks to apply.
Now if that’s not the case, something is wrong. Sending a web notice and doing the owl chat are the
fastest ways to reach someone.

That was the case but not by my choice. I had to update my address and then wait for them to
send me an access code in the mail so I could log in to the system. They were able to see when I
first contacted them about the address issue and back date my claim, thankfully.

Unfortunately, a week is nothing when it comes to Oregon unemployment. I spent every single day
for 2+ weeks on hold from just before 8am to 5pm when the like just cut off. I never got through, but
eventually around the three week mark someone called me in reply to my Frances message.

Last time I was dealing with unemployment, I would spend the On Hold time going through papers, closets,

Ending up with lots of bags of crap to be thrown away or donated. It felt like I wasn't "wasting my time" that
way.

I just tell everyone to just show up at the unemployment nearest office. It's a requirement anyways for your
claim so it's just faster to go straight to an office and deal with a person face to face.

you should definitely contact worksource. they're not like... ya know... the official unemployment
people but they're adjacent and they know their shit (and are also a lot easier to get ahold of). also,
you should use the live chat option on Frances (not send a message). you can connect with an agent
pretty easily/quickly that way

Yeah, I second visiting an office. You may have to sit for a while but they'll eventually see you and
everyone I spoke to that works there is kind and helpful. I was trying to schedule an appointment with
a call and never got off of hold so I just went in.

derpinpdx •18d ago
A Worksource employee might be able to help, at the very least to bump you up in queue. The office
has wifi etc so you can access the Frances portal while working with the employee.
If that fails a friend had recent success contacting her district rep

I’ve been on since June. The phones are effectively dead, it’s a waste of time. Just go into an office, I’ve only
done walk ins and it’s always less than 30 min.
I also tried something with the dispute process. From the time you get it in the system as an actual dispute it
will take 1-2 months for a hearing, whether on France’s or if you talk to someone in person.

I have used the live chat a couple of times and folks have been helpful and efficient. It can

the phone. Just sign in click on “the owl” and type Live Chat into the search area. If you have a
chance to go into a Worksource office they will assist you in getting online and hooked into
Frances login.

i remember one point when i was interviewing with someone or it was my first day or something and
unemployment actually called me back. i actually left the interview/meeting (can’t remember now
honestly) to take the call 😅 it was to get credit for my out of state work history, which was most of
my work history at the time, so i had been getting less than my full benefits for like four months at
that point.

I apply in the summer as I have a long work break. It always takes about a month to get the first check. A
buddy said they went to an office (not sure if it’s WorkSource or Employment Department) and they helped
them get the ball rolling. They will send you notices in the Frances portal that you need to do something and
the deadline was yesterday so that was the only time I called them. If you call them after hours and leave a
message they’re usually pretty quick to respond.
What’s your question for them?
