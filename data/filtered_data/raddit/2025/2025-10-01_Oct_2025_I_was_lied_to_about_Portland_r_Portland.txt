I was lied to about Portland
Discussion
What a beautiful, fun, quirky city with so many nice friendly people. I just finished a little 3 day trip here and I
didn’t expect to love Portland as much as I did, not to say I was going to hate it in anyway but it did leave a lasting
impression on me.
First off all the trees and nature right in the city was an amazing sight and I loved walking around Washington park
for an afternoon. I also quite enjoyed walking around all the neighborhoods, they all seemed to have a lot of
charm and character.
Getting around was also super easy thanks to Max, buses, and just the walkability throughout. I know nationally
Portland seems to get a bad rep in the media for being a liberal “ hellhole” but it couldn’t be farther from the truth.
I didn’t feel unsafe at all and I thought it was very clean for a city.
Just want to thank the city for a fun getaway and I can’t wait to come back and explore more.

And really, the whole stretch from late March through mid June involves lots of different
flowering trees and plants, not just in parks but in most residential areas. It still rains a fair amount
then, but after the spring time change it's just brighter; and there are lots of sun breaks for
walking. I'd recommend that time for tourists who don't mind occasionally being a little damp.

As someone who grew up with far more vivid fall colors than we get here, the spring flowers

I'm not saying they aren't uncomfortable after you've adapted to our weather, but compared to

My partners father visited us (we’re in Vancouver) from Texas about two years ago. He wanted to see
the mountains and asked where the best view would be. When I recommended Pittock Mansion, he
absolutely refused to even drive through the city to get there. Wouldn’t hear a word of it not being
terrible and that he wouldn’t even be off the freeway until after passing through downtown. Dude
seems to have a hair trigger fear response.

On one hand, the people who exaggerate Portland’s negatives or outright lie are the people you’re fine

On the other, if they visited reality for a bit maybe they’d shut the fuck up about Portland and the cultural
perception of it would begin to improve.
Can’t count on the loudest voices against Portland to see anything close to a well-rounded reality,

A lot of Portland residents or former residents still see the city as the small city it was 20-30 years ago.
Not that it was actually small then, but Portland has grown significantly in that time. In many ways,
this is a great thing. But it does mean we have a lot of the problems most other big cities do, to one
degree or another. For example, Portland is one of the safest big cities in the nation in terms of
violent crime. But the growth can bring crime, especially when times are tough, and the last five years
have held their challenges.

And it's a wildly different perspective living somewhere longer term and seeing the changes
versus seeing the comparison to other places.
When I moved here in 2006 I remember people cautioning me about being at night downtown or
the Esplanade. But having come from an actually big metro area, it felt a bit quaint and 200% safe
and no issues.
Context and perspective are "fun" in that both viewpoints can actually be valid.

I'd also say that you can't take many Oregonians at face value when they describe Portland.
Not because they intend to be dishonest, but because Oregon is very rural. So, if you come from
Heppner or Estacada, Portland is the biggest, scariest, urban place you've ever seen, so you will
describe it as an urban hell-hole.
If you've ever been to San Francisco, or Los Angeles, or Detroit, or Atlanta, well then you'd find
Portland quaint and cute.

I'm guilty, it's hard not to miss living downtown with Satryicon, Embers, Ash Street, La Luna,

And the issues were the same as today, but the drugs of choice were a different flavor. The
food then wasn't horrible either. There were plenty of good restaurants and cafes, and the
beer was better since the micro breweries brewed stuff other than IPAs back then.

I grew up on the east coast and have lived all over the country. Portland is easily my favorite city I've lived in,
and I don't plan on ever leaving. I chuckle and shrug when I go back east and people act thankful I'm still
alive coming out of the warzone. I'm also just shocked by how overdeveloped the east coast is when I go
back, like every square inch has been smoothed over and developed, endless highways snaking around
everything. Portland has a good city density, but I can hop in my car and be in damn near wilderness quickly.
