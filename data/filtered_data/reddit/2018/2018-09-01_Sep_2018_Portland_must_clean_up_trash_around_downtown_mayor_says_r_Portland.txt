Every morning, and I mean every morning. I see this older guy dressed in fluorescent clothing walking 5-10
miles and picking up trash . So he ends up with around 5 canvas bags full. Assume it's his daily workout . It's
in a Suburb, I have huge respect for this man. Be the change you want to see in Portland

Alternatively: Expect the city to take care of one of one of its core responsibilities. Big respect for that
dude, and I clean up a fair amount of stuff in my street and when fishing myself. But the city needs to
step up its game. Not just downtown. Install a garbage bin at every damn TriMet stop and take care of
the garbage strewn around highways and other major corridors. I don't care whose responsibility those
roads are, it's a fucking disgrace and needs to be taken care of.

Portland taxpayers and downtown businesses already pay for the Clean & Safe District, a 213-block
segment of downtown monitored by roaming cleaning crews and security teams each day of the
week. Crews removed 724 tons of garbage and more than 27,000 needles from downtown last year,
according to the district's figures.
27,000 needles! I had no idea it was so many.
16
fidelitypdx •7y ago
You should look at the trend.
It's probably going to be 40,000 this year.
What's really insane is the needle exchange program. Multnomah County programs are exchanging 5
million needles in 2017 - and they claim that 99.9% of those needles are accounted for. Do the math on
that.
The drug problem is huge.

FixShitUp •7y ago
Do the math on that.
5k unaccounted for (or 5,500 if you use the 5.5m figure from the article).

I pay the Clean & Safe tax and I pay for garbage removal too. What Wheeler, I hesitate to call him Mayor,
didn't say is the City has already raised taxes on garbage removal, about 20% for my account, to fund
street garbage removal. To simplify it, we are paying for the problem he's allowed.

"I don't think it's rocket science," the mayor said.
Yet Wheeler hinted that cleaning up trash around the city is more complicated than it may seem.

No, earlier this year at a conference in Seattle he explained "The last 3 mayors of Portland were single-
term Mayors" and went on about how he's following their footsteps.
He never wanted to be Mayor in the first place, he was lining up to be Governor after Kitzhaber's final
term. Kitzhaber's girlfriend fucked up the pecking order and put Brown in office. Brown will win reelection
this season and be in until 2022.

Problem with putting more trash cans around Downtown is that the aggressive junkies would dig through
them in search for bottles/cans while spewing the trash out onto streets. Even locked ones, they manage to
break into them and dig out the trash.

Every morning I walk downtown around 6am and what do I see? Every garbage can, flipped or open, trash
strewn everywhere. Every parking lot littered, every dumpster picked through.
It's a trash wonderland. Good luck, Mr. Mayor. And maybe think about moving those homeless camps.

What boggles my mind the most is this guy's view. He sits in this alcove and looks across Naito at the
park - the only thing in his view is Mills End Park and a Portland Loo. He looks at a bathroom all day, yet
pisses and shits on the sidewalk.
I'm so tired of the smell I go around the other side of the block just to avoid him.

I travel to Portland for work quite often and all the hotels I stay in around downtown provide earplugs. The
noise of the digging through trash is shockingly loud and travels pretty far in the area. I assume it must be
because of the can deposits and people are looking to 'cash in'?

Not just downtown either. The parking lot at my work is riddled with store ads and garbage. I even see
people dumping shit out of their car.
Whenever I clean up garbage, I make an effort to glare at the offender or make them feel guilty. People need
to be held accountable.
