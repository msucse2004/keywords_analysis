Clean Energy Jobs bill continues Oregon's legacy of stewardship
What can a lawmaker do that I cannot? They have the power to create broad, systemic change to permanently transition our economy away from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. To do that lawmakers will need to rebuff special interests in favor of the common interest. In the spirit of Tom McCall, I hope they do.
We can all gain hope when we notice iconic brands commit to the low- or no-carbon economy. Companies like Apple, Nike, Intel, Coca Cola, Bank of America, eBay, Facebook and WalMart have made public commitments to take responsibility for their carbon footprints. These companies have learned that reducing greenhouse gas emissions saves money. They have also learned that sticking to old, polluting ways of doing business alienates customers.
It may be comforting to some that we are not first: in fact we are following the lead of California, Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, all of which passed pioneering legislation years ago and their robust economies haven't suffered a bit. Nine states in the Northeast use a similar system to reduce pollution from their utilities. It's working so well that two other states are in the process of joining them. Washington state is also considering requiring large emitters to pay for their greenhouse gases.
