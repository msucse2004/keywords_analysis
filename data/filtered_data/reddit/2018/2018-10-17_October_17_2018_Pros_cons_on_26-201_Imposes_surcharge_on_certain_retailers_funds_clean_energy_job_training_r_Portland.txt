Pros/cons on 26-201: Imposes surcharge on certain retailers; funds clean energy, job
training
Can people weigh in on their thoughts on this measure? My biggest political concern is the environment, and I do
believe that megacorporations should be on the hook for the environmental damage that they cause. But I'm
reminded of the corporate tax that failed two years ago - not because people were against the spirit of the tax, but
more because it was poorly constructed ("Revise and resubmit" - same thing happened with cannabis legalization).
Do you have any concerns about this measure that could be addressed with different wording in two years, or if
you're against it, is that philosophical opposition to taxation that no tweaks could overcome?
Thanks.

From the opinion:
This takes the prize for the measure with the best intentions but the worst execution among any we've seen
this year.
We understand the powerful appeal of Portland's Clean Energy Initiative. Backers say it would help low-
income Portlanders and communities of color save money on their utility bills by making their homes more

historically underserved communities. Create
The rationale undergirding this idea: Utility costs and the impacts of climate change both disproportionately
affect low-income and minority Portlanders.
The source of the proposed funding will also appeal to many voters. The initiative would slap a new tax on
big corporations such as WalMart, Comcast and Wells Fargo. Such national giants are easy targets. They make
lots of money, pay low rates of state income tax and just got a windfall from President Donald Trump's tax
plan.
Half to three-quarters of the money raised would be spent on energy efficiency and projects that reduce
carbon emissions. The rest would go toward job training for low-income and minority workers. Proponents,
who include more than 150 nonprofits representing a wide range of environmental, community and labor
groups, paint a picture of low-income Portlanders installing solar panels, new insulation and better windows
on their homes, creating jobs and helping to meet the city's ambitious carbon reduction targets.
Sounds good, right? Well, there are a few problems both in who'd actually pay the tax and how the money
would be spent.
First, although proponents deny it, the tax would fall hardest on the very people it's supposed to help: the
poor. The initiative imposes a tax on gross receipts—that means sales. In an analysis of the measure last year,
the city's Revenue Division asserted "some businesses will partially or wholly pass the [tax] on to consumers in
the form of a price increase."
Second, the measure does not require that investment of the tax dollars in energy efficiency actually go to
the homes of low-income Portlanders. Measure guidelines say that "at least half of the grants in this category
should specifically benefit low-income people and people of color." Why not all of it? Why allow half to go to
people who are neither low-income or people of color? And in legal terms, the word "should" is not the same
as "must." In fact, it's such a weak guideline that all the money could be spent entirely for the benefit of
middle-class whites.
Nobody agrees on how much money the tax might raise. Estimates range from $35 million to $79 million a
year. That's a big variance. And unlike many special-purpose taxes approved by voters—such as the Portland
Children's Levy or funding for the Oregon Historical Society, both of which must be reapproved regularly by
voters—there is no sunset clause for the Clean Energy Fund. Even the Multnomah County Library employed
temporary funding for 36 years before becoming a permanent taxing district in 2012.
So we have a tax that would come out of the pockets of people it claims to help, with no guarantees the
money would go to them, or any way to shut the spigot off if the experiment fails.
And, as the left-leaning group Tax Fairness Oregon points out, Portland is already far ahead of most cities in
terms of weatherization, which, in any case, is not the most pressing challenge Portlanders face. "This
measure appears to put the climate far above the education of our children, where we rank bottom in the
country, housing our citizens, or preparation for a seismic event," the group said in a Voters' Pamphlet
statement. "Let's put our limited resources towards our biggest problems." Vote no.

Pretty disingenuous to imply that a 1% tax on retailers will directly effect the poor IMCrOeate
As an architect, I can tell you that weatherization is bad overall, and we are actually a very poor city in
terms of overall building energy performance, despite aggressive codes - we have too many buildings
that have never been improved and had to meet code.

I'm voting against. The measure was triangulated by polling in its design to pass.
The measure duplicates long-running programs by the Energy Trust of Oregon, which instead should be
expanded. That includes low income insulation, solar and employment programs to install them. We could
also boost Americorps insulation programs. There are strong utility programs and trade group programs, like
the electricians union, to train up new workers for energy installation.
The money collected would be directed by a self-managed board, with board members appointed by the
previous board.
For some big retailers, the 1% is going to create a dilemma in Internet sales for local pickup where prices
should be the same everywhere.
The focus needs to be on the 2019 legislature cap and trade bill and the distribution of those funds for these
projects by already established groups. We also should look at how Washington 1631, if it passes distributes
money, and learn from that.
I believe we need a much greater portion of the state budget from corporate taxation. But it should come
from taxes on profits, not on sales, which this is.
My neutral on this issue legal sources believe that if it passes, it will eventually never take effect because it will
fail in litigation as to its Oregon legality after several years and a lot of legal costs paid for by the city. That is
because it was poorly designed.
If you want a really radical climate change law in Portland, require all rentals to publish an energy score, or
better, a detailed energy audit. Hire businesses with verified low income job training and employment
practices, perhaps through PCC, to do the audits. Create an incentive for landlords to use weatherization
trade allies who are hiring previously low income employees.

Skip to main content
problem facing the world. The Oregon legislature needs to take action to enable utilitieCs rteoa ateccount for
carbon in their planning - right now by law they can only build what's least-cost in absolute terms - but this is
NOT a good interim solution.
Here's why I hate it:
1. It's a waste of money. Utilities already go out and aquire all cost effective energy efficiency and this has
been studied and shown to be reaching lower income communities across the NW. So this bill would be
proposing to buy above-market energy efficiency and things like rooftop solar here in the PDX area
where our solar resource is terrible compared to Eastern OR (which our utilities have access to). Solar out
there generates twice the energy (because its sunnier) at a third of the cost (because it's utility scale).
Thats how you develop renewables at a scale that matters. Not on rooftops.
If the goal is to decrease rates for low income communities, just increase the subsidy for those folks. We
already have a bill assistance program that 25% of PGE's customers qualify for. Get more of them enrolled if
that is the goal, increase the subsidy if that's the goal, but if the goal is to build renewable energy, do it in the
desert for solar and in the gorge/montana for wind.
2) It targets business with a tax that they can do nothing to avoid. If you want to tax businesses for their
carbon, use a carbon tax. Instead this bill taxes them for sales and gives them no avenue to reduce their fee
through any environmental action. All of this while, for example, Walmart enrolled in the 'Green Direct'
program in Puget Sound to power 12 of their stores with renewable energy. If/when PGE rolls out the same
program for our area, Walmart choosing to do the same thing wouldn't help them lower this fee. Crazy!
3) It challenges a sector of the economy that is likely to see enormous job losses over the next 15 years and
doesn't have any impact on groups like amazon or etc. If you want to hear a great argument for this, check
out https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/55856209 .

Agree. To point 3, Amazon and the like need to price carbon into their last mile delivery systems. It would
be great to see that line item at checkout: carbon cost of delivery.

I think that last mile delivery might be less than you think. I order a lot of things on Amazon that I
would need to get a Home Depot. That's a 15 minute drive for me...for a specific bolt. Osh is out of
business and the local hardware stores have crap weekend hours and small stock so their not and
option. An Amazon truck delivering packages to a hundred people is going to use a lot less gas than
me driving to Home Depot and back.

As posted by another, WW recommended no. Oregonian also recommends no. The Mercury and the Tribune
both endorsed it.
Oregonian: https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2018/10/editorial_endorsement_vote_no_3.html -
this one I think gets the prize for worst argument against (the WW makes a nearly identical argument against
in a more general way that is much more cogent) by throwing a fit about "banks would just pass it through to
the consumer" but since only the largest organizations are subject to the tax, they can't exactly pass it
through without finding themselves overpriced compared to their smaller competitors (credit unions, etc...)
and with the heavy underlying pressure for people to find local banking options I think Wells/BoA/etc... will
think long and hard before passing through extra fees.

One of my big issues with it is that it considers wind to be a “green energy” when it really has similar pitfalls
as hydro power, which considered to not be green. Wind turbines kill bats and birds (though to a lesser
extent) similar to how dams kills salmon. It also excludes nuclear power as a potential energy source. We
definitely need more renewables but I took issue with those definitions.

Good lord, what's left? Solar alone? I suspect that eventually the manufacturing process for those panels
will be found to disrupt the roosting areas of endangered sugar gliders, and there will be no "green
energy" sources. We might be letting the perfect be the enemy of the good here - hydro and wind might
do some damage to some animals but coal (which, granted, is not big in Oregon) damages the planet on
which all animals live.
Probably, in light of that, it's worth noting that this measure provides funds for weatherization and energy
efficiency measures rather than construction of debatably-green power sources.

of a less manageable power source was a deal breaker for me. You can make your own decisions.
Some Bat species are on course for extinction due to wind power and we can’t subsidize them the
way we can with salmon. Fewer bats means more pesticides in agricultural areas where bats are
hugely beneficial.

It says "certain types of hydropower" - which led me to investigate what types of hydropower
there are. Apparently there's a river variety, which presumably would be damaging to fish, and a
reservoir style, which would probably be considered to be more "green." I'm not yet familiar with
which type supplies the bulk of Oregon's hydropower.

They both have pros and cons - reservoirs require clearing out lots of land for the reservoir
that otherwise could be park/grazing/agriculture/housing

I’m calling BS on wind power affecting bats, and will dig into the funding and scientific stats for
this study you posted. Wind generators definitely exist in the flight path of migratory birds, but
bats don’t fly that high and largely stick to buildings and lower altitudes nearer to obstacles
where they hunt and live. Unless they’re trying to roost and hunt up and down wind turbines, this
doesn’t add up to me and seems like a false discrediting study from a player with skin in the
game.

It’s definitely a thing. There aren’t good population estimates for Bat populations (many of
which have crashed since 2006) so how much of a concern it is can be debated, but since each
Bat only had one pup per year, any fatality is gonna have an impact over time.
There are 40+ species of bats and several species do migrate at heights where they encounter
turbines. We don’t know all their migration routes either. Both direct contact and barotrauma
are thought to be responsible for their fatalities.
The dramatic growth of wind energy throughout much of the world is also taking a
huge toll on bats.
Scientists estimate that hundreds of thousands of bats are killed each year in the
United States by collisions with the spinning blades of wind turbines or rapid pressure
change at turbines that can rupture blood vessels. BCI and its partners have been
working since 2004 to minimize bat fatalities at wind sites.

fatalities. There are several migratory Bat species, including the three spCecreieast ewe found most
often at this site (although since it was in a white-nose syndrome area in 2012, there were
fewer other Bat species generally). The three bats we found most frequently were Hoary Bats
(Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris
noctivagans). The hoary Bat has had a genus change but most of the papers you’ll find online
still list the old one (which I listed for that reason).
There are studies on potential mitigation strategies and you can find papers about them at
batsandwind.org but I don’t feel the measure is sufficient to get my vote.

evanstravers •7y ago
Interesting! I guess your personal experience is enough to convince me. Did you have any
guesses as to why bats were so affected?
2
remotectrl •7y ago
🌇
We don’t totally know! There’s a theory that the bats most effected, which roost in
trees, might be approaching them like they would trees. There are several acoustic
deterrents that have been devised to tell the bats to stay away but I don’t know if any
have had great success yet. They might also be foraging near them. It’s a complicated
issue since we need to pursue renewable energy.
2
evanstravers •7y ago
Certainly, which is part of the reason for my disbelief. My uncle is a researcher for
Audubon and has seen increased activity by oil & gas companies to fund studies
that have outcomes that would work against the spread of renewables.

Frankly, people care a lot more about birds than bats and while some of the
early designs for wind turbines (which were smaller and had scaffolding) were
pretty bad for birds, many people seem unaware of the issues with bats or
might not really care. I wouldn’t be surprised if industries tried to take
advantage of that apathy.

While bats are arguably more critical to ecosystems, birds are just cuter.
