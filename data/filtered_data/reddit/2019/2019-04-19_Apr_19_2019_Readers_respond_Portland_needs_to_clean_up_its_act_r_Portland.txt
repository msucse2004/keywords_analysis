If I can bother everyone for a second while they’re busy impugning the author, have you guys looked around
lately? I don’t care what the Idahoan says about our city, it just happens that he’s right. It’s exceptionally filthy
and has gotten worse these last couple years. Don’t we, as residents and taxpayers, feel this problem too?

BigSwedenMan •7y ago •Edited 7y ago
Yeah, why do we care where the author is from? He has enough familiarity with Portland to see that the
problem is growing. We've been saying this ourselves for a long time. It's a constant complaint around
here. Yet it still seems that nothing is being done about it. It's not just here either. It's a growing problem
in a lot of cities. It's to the point where the federal government should be trying to address this, however I
suspect the current administration would just try to deport them to Mexico

littlep2000 •7y ago
To offer a real answer to that question. I think it is because Portland is often a target of conservative
rage given the general political view. It is literally a huge reason Patriot Prayer shows up here versus
other cities. Sometimes these articles feel like they hinge completely on "Look at this city filled with
liberals, they can't manage themselves!'
That said, I don't think that's where this article comes from, especially as the author claims to be a
relatively recent resident.

empress02 •7y ago•Edited 7y ago
In all fairness, conservative leaning cities typically have a much more hardline approach to drug
use and lawlessness, which are the problems Portland is currently plagued with. Conservative
cities aren't big on slapping the wrists of habitual offenders who are 99.9% guaranteed to
reoffend. They usually sentence them and put them away. I don't want to debate who is right or
wrong, but the liberal leanings of our city are a large part of the blame for the situation we've
created.

"Look at this city filled with liberals, they can't manage themselves!'
To that point, have you been to mega-liberal San Francisco? In 2011, just over 5,500 reports of
public shit were logged by the San Francisco Department of Public Works; in 2018, the number
increased to more than 28,000
Or lesser, but still very liberal Los Angeles where you literally can't drive down the freeway without
seeing tent cities on every over/underpass
California's de facto status as a one-party state lies at the heart of its problem. With a permanent
majority in the state Senate and the Assembly, a prolonged dominance in the executive branch,
and a weak opposition, California Democrats have long been free to indulge blue-state ideology
while paying little or no political price. The state's problems will not improve.
California increasingly stands out as an extremist and increasingly dysfunctional basket case.
Wealthy residents can withstand the state's failures, but everyone else is paying the price of bad
policy. No city better reflects the end result of California-style progressivism than San Francisco.
Though it is one of the wealthiest cities in the country, San Francisco is becoming known for its
notorious homelessness problem, escalating crime rates, and various other pathologies.

A spike in housing prices have no correlation to the spike in drug addicts on the street, who
generally would not have been buying/renting anyhow.
1
midianite_rambler •7y ago
People on the margins of polite society -- this includes people on disability, mental illness,
dead-end minimum wage jobs, irregular work history, chronic medical problems, etc etc, in
addition to drug users -- were able, for many decades, to keep a roof over their heads
because there was enough housing that they could afford. That might be pretty marginal, but
it is far better than being on the street. What has changed recently -- I would say that, in
Portland, it started in the 90's and picked up steam in the 00's -- is that the formerly
affordable housing has largely disappeared. Either it has been renovated and the rent
increased 3x or 4x or whatever, or it has been demolished and replaced by new construction
that is, again, much more expensive than what it replaced.
In this circumstance, some people will adapt in one way or another, and some won't be able
to swing it. It's just an arithmetic problem -- take n thousands of people in low-rent housing,
and increase the rent faster than their incomes increases. What's going to happen? Is it
actually "complicated" to figure out what's the consequences?

This highlights an important first step, we need to separate street people from the homeless. I think
our street people problem is whats really the issue, and the first step in tackling that is address the
drug and the black market stolen goods pipeline that goes up and down i5 to seattle and down to
Ukiah. Its not fair to lump these people in with the homeless, they are two separate issues.

I'm more confused as to what everyone thinks is so great about Portland. I've lived here my whole
life, and I love this city (even when I bitch about it I still love it) and I mean what makes us that
special? I guess we got a sports team but I don't see anything flash out like Pikes Place, or
Hollywood, etc... We've got some good eats, and quite a fair bit of beer but... I'll admit our
outdoors and proximity to parks is amazing, and if that's why you are here I get it.
However... I don't see anyone going to OMSI and being wowed by displays that were old when I
was a kid several decades ago. Or hitting up the sleepy animals at the Zoo.... If I was going on
vacation, and someone listed attractions like PDX I'd pass and save up for a better destination.

A lot of people these days go on vacation to cities just eat at places they've read

No one is coming to Portland expecting something like Hawaii or Vegas.
I used to host travelers to Portland, a lot of people from the rest of the US or the
world are just curious to see the area after hearing about it, it's usually not just
Portland that's on their itinerary. Also while the mountains here aren't a big deal in

I'm not surprised that someone from a smaller rural town had a strong reaction to the homeless / street
population problem in a major west coast city.
What's a little more surprising to me as a Portland resident is how much more vocal the local progressives
I know have gotten about this. Nearly every day I'm hearing someone I know personally talk about how
severe the problem has gotten, and they're typically upset or frustrated by it. And these are proud card-
carrying liberal types. I think the local government establishment may be closer to experiencing the
consequences of that anger than they may think.

When I talk to my friends and they complain about the homeless population, I ask em, so what would
you do about it? I don't ever get a really good answer, it's usually "I'm upset and we should do
something."
Honestly that is part of the problem, no one has a real good solution. I personally think a campagin to
tell people not to donate to pan handlers but instead give money to a city charity program might
help, shutting down the underground bike trade, and starting to look at service friendly vs service
resistant homeless might go a long way to starting that process.

It's a catch 22 issue though. You invest and improve homeless services, than other cities start

It's also a waste of fucking money when it comes to the value of the bike. Instead of
spending a stupid amount of money putting someone in jail for a bike instead we
should be preventing the market for selling them.
Could do this through a public information campaign, some kind of 'check if your bike
is stolen' registry, and maybe some kind of bike buying market where everyone there
has been verified not to have stolen goods. Sure some people will still buy stolen
goods but if you make it harder to sell those goods you'll discourage a large portion
of people.

Robbie_MFB •7y ago
Yes and no. On its face the cost of sending someone to prison for bike theft is
nonsense. However, the long term ramification of that thought process brings us
to our current state of affairs in this city. There is no protection and seemingly no
rights to our property as taxpaying, law-abiding citizens in this city. The people
that are allowed to steal our shit with no consequence then go on and make
public spaces that are paid for and maintained by taxpayers unusable and
downright dangerous for the very taxpayers who have provided these public
spaces.

I guess with everyone being so budget conscious here, I can't see plugging up

fiscally. There are better cost effective solutions that can work if there was the
desire to even try. I agree the current status quo is bullshit, and something
needs to change. However if locking people up doesn't stop them from doing
drugs, it's not going to stop anyone from stealing bikes.

elhombregordo •7y ago
You may be right, but it is more likely that the bicycle thieves, if they were denied
a market for bicycle thievery, would simply shift to other forms of crime - breaking
and entering, car theft, mugging, etc. If you arrest and prosecute the bicycle
thieves, you would not only be deterring future bicycle thievery, but other forms
of crime as well. It's the broken window theory, and it worked very well for NYC.

I don't think it's that simple. Giuliani happened to take office at the same time as a
general decline began in crime rates from their late 80s - early 90s high. And 'tough
on crime' policies can't be fully credited with the reduction; research has indicated
that crime rate declines may have been influenced by reduction of lead in the
environment as well as availability of contraception and family planning services.

midianite_rambler •7y ago
Giuliani got a lot of mileage out of being lucky enough to be in office when there
was a sustained nationwide decrease in crime rates.
4
elhombregordo •7y ago
Yeah, I'd have to ask for sources on that contraception and family planning thing.
It is true, however, that real number crime rates went down around that down
because the relative population increase went down (boomers were aging and
there were less Gen X young men of crime age to take their place). But, crime is
not the only concern NYC had. They had a general rot going on which
accompanied the crime rate - a sort of ghettoization of the city, which was
reversed as well. Even if the crime rate in Portland were reduced, but the tent cities
downtown weren't, Portland would still rot.

OK, so you don't like the culture there, but what do the police there actually do? Do they
arrest people for vagrancy? For panhandling? For drugs? For bicycle theft? Because if the
answer is no, then essentially you have a less green-and-purple-haired version of
Portland. Being a conservative area doesn't mean squat unless they implement
conservative policies.

Alternatively, one could just live in Idaho, which is one of the most depressing places on the planet. Trust me I

So I agree with the opinion that problems need addressing, but the author being from Idaho actually does
matter, because people just visiting and making obnoxious pleas to “clean it up” might need to at least ack
that this place is worth cleaning up.

Maybe he can't complain about his hometown anymore, due to past problems in doing so...

Stop electing folks like Hardesty and Eudaly and get someone who wants to discourage the homeless like
they do elsewhere.

Do you have some examples? Because from my understanding, every major west coast city has the same
problems.

To be fair, every west coast city has similar politicians.

The problem is that the trash-tent-city homeless issue has nothing to do with rent affordability (it's pretty
Skip to main content
easy to check the homeless surveys they take to back this up - most aren't from here, anCdre aartee addicted to
drugs). But because votes, and because rent gouging really is a problem with developers and landlords, the
politicians refuse to look at it any other way. People with jobs who get evicted for high rent don't move into a
trash tent and start taking meth. They go to family, friends, or cars. Sure there's some exceptions, but the data
doesn't lie. It is a drug and health problem, and it is also a USA internal migration problem, with cities busing
homeless back and forth in some weird resource war. There's so much more going on, but the city council,
Eudaly especially, who I agree with on most things, just keeps chanting affordability. Yeah, to get a lot drug
addicts out of tents you're basically going to have to pay them to live indoors. Lots of documentaries on skid
row in LA say the same thing. Many choose this life. I lived in SF for 5 years and saw it there. They move there
because that's where the resources are - clinics etc. Not because they grew up in SF. Same here. Go to a trash
tent city. Ask them.

We have skyrocketing rents, our tech jobs are taken by transplants, and we have no mechanism to save the
vulnerable among us from falling into homelessness.
What the NIMBY set needs to recognize is that this is a biproduct of system. Joblessness and unemployment
is built in to the system. The human cost is being paid by them, for the system that keeps us in cars and
phones and houses and clothes and the glut of consumer nonsense we fill out lives with.
What we should be asking is how we house them, not how we get rid of them.
