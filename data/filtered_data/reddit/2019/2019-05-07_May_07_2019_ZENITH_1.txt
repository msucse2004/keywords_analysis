requirement to show it could control and clean up a major crude spill at its Willamette

Smith said he did not force Zenith to conduct the drill with tar sands oil because he felt pressure to go
along with other agencies’ decision to allow the company to practice with diesel.
Wait, what? I get it, Zenith Energy should not have used diesel but this guy's whole job is to make sure they're
compliant. "Feeling pressured" makes no sense unless he took a bribe or was told by higher ups to allow
Zenith to do what they wanted. If it's the latter, we have a much deeper problem on our hands and the
people responsible need to be removed.

This.
Also, doesn’t this mean that Zenith didn’t really break any rules? If they were allowed to use diesel... and
they did... of course they shouldn’t face consequences.
The problem is with the agencies who hold oil companies accountable. They need stricter rules. That’s
what the article should be about.
Of course Zenith should do the right thing... but welcome to the world.. companies often choose not to
do the right thing in order to save money and time. This happens in all industries.

And we have whistleblower protections for just this reason.
If Smith saw a problem he could have easily reported it. Instead, he tells the paper he's confused why
Zenith did what they did after the fact.

We all know for a fact that the agencies tasked with regulating the oil industry are compromised. Easily
done since most of the higher ups are appointed.

“Scott Smith, says he was flummoxed by Zenith’s recalcitrance.”
Whoa. Quite the vocabulary.

if there's no pressure from voters, regulators will get cozy with corporations. this is on all of us. maybe if our
alt weeklies did serious journalism instead of clickbait crap and their trying to help start a civil war with patriot
prayer/antifa....

why is anyone surprised anymore when oil companies can do whatever they want and face no repercussions?
this has been happening since the invention of the internal combustion engine and everyone acts like it's
some major breakthrough every time, yet we ultimately do nothing to fix it because the oil industry is
greasing the pockets of most of the politicians in all stages of government.

why is anyone surprised anymore
Because we can't understand how inhuman companies can be. It's too alien to understand that
companies literally do not, even can not, care about anything but profits.

I very much agree with this. Once a company goes public, it is basically nothing more than a large
profit machine that is indifferent to other human concerns. "Evil corporation?" No, just a big machine
doing what it was programmed to do. "Corporate Philanthropy" No, just the machine's strategy for
manipulating humans for optimizing profits.
I think this kind of pragmatic view of what companies are would allow us to more clearly modify the
rules for better outcomes.
