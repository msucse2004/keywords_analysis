I did some work on the Tillamook Row project. The units are cool, but they were a pain in the ass to build.

Do tell. You wouldn’t happen to know the per unit cost would you?

That's great and all, but greenwashing ads like this neglect to mention the embedded energy that went into
the manufacturing of finished goods and processing of the raw materials.
In the case of motor vehicles and building materials, the embedded energy comprises over 90% of the energy
used during its useful lifespan. Most home building materials on the market these days have useful lifespans
of less than 20 years, so even with factoring that in, they're still net energy consumers.
This is why reuse is frequently the most energy efficient option.

Correct, this is especially true with solar panels. I'm a big fan of solar, but I don't kid myself about the
limits of the technology and the decidedly non-green method of manufacturing them, either. Wind and
large thermally-based solar plants make much more sense in the long run.

Shouldn’t they be called plus-energy homes, or power homes?
