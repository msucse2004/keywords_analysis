expecting a team of bio-hazard janitors to be first-aid providers and social workers is a bit... ambitious. still
better than doing nothing tho.

Squad Deep in the Clack
In the last fiscal year, the program cleaned 3,122 campsites, removed 8,400 gallons of human waste, 1,300
tons of garbage, and removed 28,909 hypodermic syringes.
—————————-
Sand, a homeless advocate with the newspaper of the same name, asked for a six-month delay before
approving a new contract to allow advocates and others to figure out an alternative to the One Point of
Contact system.
—————————-
However, that would likely mean no clean-ups would happen for six months
^ YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME.
So we can accumulate approx. 4,200 gallons of HUMAN WASTE, 750 tons of trash, and 15,450 needles and let
that shit slooooow cook until JUNE when it’ll caked and baked all over the city.
What the fuck is wrong with us.

If you see needles of the EASY TOUCH brand, they pretty much came from the Multnomah County
program.

Portland and other cities alike are amazing recruitment tools for Repbublicans. If this is "progressive" policies
at work -- as a visitor or tourist take a stroll down any urban street in Portland and ask yourself, "would I want
this in my city or town?"
Add in some Fox News reports on lawless, homeless overrun cities on the West Coast and you've got some
new Republicans voting in Trump de jour every election.
If you landed in Portland from another country without any concept of local politics; it would be a logical
conclusion those in charge locally are not doing an effective job. And they're right.

sanitary for people living outside and to appease business owners and neighbors who are upset about
homeless camps.
Excuse me? Appease neighbors? What the fuck? We're not doing this to, ya know, actually keep
neighborhoods safe? So my kids don't fall on needles at the nearby park?
No, we're just merely "appeasing" all these NIMBYs. I hate our city officials so much.

Protesting
Street Roots Executive Director Kaia Sand also called for a reconsideration of the contract. Sand, a
homeless advocate with the newspaper of the same name, asked for a six-month delay before
approving a new contract to allow advocates and others to figure out an alternative to the One Point
of Contact system.
Six month moratorium on sweeps? FUCK NO!

Imagine what things will look like at that point and how much more it will cost to clean it up. Hardesty
and the homeless advocates will not be happy until the city is suffering the great garbage avalanches
from the movie Idiocracy.

fidelitypdx •6y ago
The most frustrating part of the Street Roots team is that they haven't figured out the alternative. The
only policy proposal they've put forward is the street response team, which launches this spring in the
Lents neighborhood. I really hope that this program is successful, but I have serious doubts it will make
an impact.
Either way, you can't be telling the public, "Don't do this, let us think of something else" when the
problem has existed for years now.

I used to buy that paper, thinking it was better than a hand out. Now it feels like they're just special
interest lobby, not actually interested in changing anything. Which I guess makes sense. The executive
director would be out of a job if the homeless crisis disappeared overnight.

I imagine the only reason they are asking for a 6 month moratorium is when they start it up again at 6
months is so they can claim its " unfair to move these people from where they have been living for the
past 6 months "

Potland, where:
1. Drug addicts are called "campers."
2. Vagrancy is called "camping."
3. Plastic straws are illegal.
4. Grocery bags cost money.
5. Drug syringes are free.

What if I get a bunch of free syringes and melt them down to make grocery bags and straws?

A lot of LA looks like Skid Row now. SF has people taking shits in grocery store aisles and dozens of
passed out people with needles hanging out of their arms in their transit stop walkwCareysa.t ePDX is puppies
and rainbows in comparison, even with all the problems we have. It's the same as when you think housing
costs have gone way up in PDX, and they're still 1/3 the price or less per square foot as the Bay Area and
Los Angeles.
