My 72 year old dad is back in the bar 8 hours a day sans mask. We sent him three different kinds of masks --
he refuses to wear any of them. Keeps calling us libtards for sending them to him.

Overlook
Honestly I feel that anyone that uses the term libtard is showing that they are hateful people who use
other slurs. It's basically calling someone retarded, which is the lamest insult in so many ways. There are
soooooo many ways to belittle people that use intellect and name calling is the laziest way and
guarantees that no intellectual debate will be had with that person. I am not a liberal if that matters 🤣
Idk I personally wouldn't insult someone solely based on their political beliefs, which I feel are akin with
religious beliefs. But I definitely know right wingers that think muslim= terrorism and dont like people just
based on their culture 🤢 Not all conservative or Republicans use that term, but it does show how hateful
many on the right side is. No wonder there are so many racists in that group!

Also the Mousetrap is in Kenton. They couldn't actually drive the rest of the way up Lombard?

Sitting inside these places just to have a drink seems incredibly reckless. On the flip side, my local bar does
not allow any inside seating and only lets people sit on the outside patio (which is actually a massive yard).
This seems like a safe compromise to me

There is a bar just up the street from me that has the best damn chicken and clam chowder as far as I care,
and better yet they open early so I can actually enjoy it (night worker). I would LOVE to go and get some

Is there any chance at all PDX stays reopened at this point? We're doing a lot better than a lot of cities and it's
still spreading like wildfire. :'(

We’re doing better comparatively than other states. I feel like they’ve made their choice at this point and
are sticking to it.

I think the thing that struck me about this article the most, is that they mentioned that there weren't many
masks to be seen being worn at the bars.
Also, karaoke is against Kate Brown's orders? Can anyone explain that to me?

Everyone shares a microphone that they are holding inches from their mouths.

Pizza Schmizza on 21st did Karaoke Friday and Saturday. Bit premature in my opinion.

I mean karaoke is just droplet transferring under the guise of dumb fun. It’s not like people who are going
out will be wearing masks while singing.

Strangely enough, the article said that the person singing at that moment was wearing a mask.

Face masks are not magical cloaks.

No, but two people wearing masks significantly reduces the transmission rate.
