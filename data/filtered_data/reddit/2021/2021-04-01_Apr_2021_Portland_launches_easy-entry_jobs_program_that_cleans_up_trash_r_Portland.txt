I said this when I moved here, heck, target the homeless camps and employ them.
They could also start putting out public garbage cans, like every other major city in the world does.

This is the answer. Put them to work and provide them an income to literally clean up their own "home."

That will hopefully give the those who are experiencing homelessness a vested interCerseta itne their
"community." Imagine, instead of just bottles and cans, they are picking up garbage and are incentivized
to do it.

An army of street cleaning services.
Japan's cleanliness is more cultural than services. We will never have enough services to be as
clean as they are given the lack of respect Americans have for the environment and public spaces.

If you employ the homeless to clean up their own mess, then what would their incentive be to keep their
camps clean?

Yup. Maybe also focus some of this effort specifically towards hiring the homeless to allow them to earn

Using TIF in those districts is a good idea. Usually a pretty big source of funding. Cleaning up obviously

Growing up in Portland there seemed to be far less trash decades ago. This is an honest question: Is the
source of most trash around the city? Homeless camps? Housed people dumping junk? Random litterbugs?
8
dootdootplot •5y ago
Lents
Homeless camps are a primary source, but also the general trashiness encourages other people to be
equally careless about dumping their own trash. What one more plastic cup or cigarette butt, when the
roadside is already covered in a trashdrift of busted tents and tarps, shopping carts, moldy clothes, and
food containers?

u/pbjars - Very curious if Portland or Multnomah County ever reached out to your clean up group or the
Solve group about more funding? Paying homeless people, etc?
Not ironically, I’ve been suggesting this for months and months..
Multnomah Countyn is hiring about a dozen people to handle illegal dumping complaints and throwing $2
million into the program.
Now the city of portland is throwing $3 million into hiring low skill people directly to clean the city.
Imagine what SOLVE could have done with an extra $5 million - makes me wonder why the city and county
don’t work with an existing program that’s been around for so long? Hopefully it’s not the $$$400,000$$$
that solve spends on advertising….

Before the sun even started to warm the day, a team of four people pulled two red wagons onto a MAX train
Monday. They got off near the Portland Convention Center and headed to work with their supplies in tow:
garbage bags, plastic gloves, trash pickers and brooms
https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2021/03/dumptown-how-portlands-trash-problem-spiraled-out-of-

The city of Portland has partnered with a nonprofit initiative named Ground Score, to tackle two needs:
address the city’s growing trash problem https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2021/03/dumptown-how-
portlands-trash-problem-spiraled-out-of-control.html and provide job opportunities open to people
experiencing homelessness and who’ve only recently found housing.
“The program is incredibly successful,” said Barbra Weber, the Ground Score employee leading Monday’s
crew. “But not for the obvious reasons, like the fact we have picked up so much trash. The bigger picture is
the personal impact.”
The pilot program, which launched in mid-February, has employed nearly 30 people who are paid $20 an
hour and have already collected more than 15,000 pounds of trash. The hours are flexible, allowing people to
sign up for four- or eight-hour shifts when it fits their schedule. They can sign up for a single shift or ask to be
scheduled on an ongoing basis.
Weber, who is paid $25 an hour as the coordinator, typically schedules two people for each shift and leaves
one spot open to allow someone to show up that morning to ask for work. Soon, paid sick time will be built
into the program.
While the program currently has five clean-up locations between the Lloyd Center and Downtown, the goal is
to expand city wide, said Katie Lindsay, the coordinator for the city’s Homelessness and Urban Camping
Impact Reduction Program who launched the partnership with Ground Score, an initiative of Trash for Peace
that promotes community sustainability.
She wants other city departments to begin offering low-barrier jobs as well.
The county has similar goals in mind. Multnomah County’s lead homelessness official is proposing to spend
$3 million from the Metro homelessness services bond on a jobs initiative
https://multco.us/file/95687/download that would hire 100 low-skilled workers in the coming year beginning
July 1. That allocation will depend on whether County Chair Deborah Kafoury puts the request in her
executive budget and the full commission approves it.
“(The money) could connect to the city’s pilot program, those are some of the details that still need to be
worked out,” said Denis Theriault, communications coordinator for the joint city-county Office of Homeless
Services. “We have a whole mess of partners doing similar work, so we will have to figure out how best to
deploy this funding to amplify and fill gaps.”
While the handful of blocks the Ground Score program focuses on are much cleaner, the program will not
solve all the city’s trash woes. However, the initiative has already deeply impacted those it has employed,
Weber said.
THE PERSONAL IMPACT
The objective of the program, Lindsay said, is to offer people work opportunities that have typically eluded
them due to circumstance. Being employed while experiencing homelessness is challenging, so providing
jobs that are flexible lowers barriers to working while unhoused.
“We aren’t giving charity, but as a government, we are trying to find out how we excluded people from
opportunities in the past and make those opportunities (like fair-paying city jobs) available for anyone,” she

Barbra Weber and Ryan Fletcher pick up trash as part of the city of Portland's partnership with Ground Score.
Terry Blaka, 48, a frequent worker on Weber’s team, said the job is his sole source of income and has changed
his life. He is currently living in transitional housing, waiting for a permanent housing placement.
“(The job) has helped me change my habits,” he said as he sat down to wait for the MAX after a three-hour
shift on his feet picking up trash. “It is an honor to be a productive member of society and it’s a wonderful
feeling how much people say they appreciate what we are doing as they walk by.”
Bud Foteff, who owns the Convention Center Auto Body shop, walked out of his shop to say hello on Monday
as Weber’s team walked by on their route – something he does each time he sees them.
“The area behind my building was such a mess and I used to spend so much time picking up everything
myself,” Foteff said. “It’s just amazing the noticeable huge difference they have made.”
About half of those employed by the program are currently homeless while the other half are newly housed,
Weber said. But both need job opportunities – moving into a home after living on the streets can be a hard
transition, she said.
“When people first call to ask about a job, I can hear the nervousness in their voice,” Weber said. “But as time
moves on, when they realize this truly is low barrier, you can see that stress lift off when they realize they
don’t have to be anything but themselves.”
The program is built to be inclusive and span physical abilities. Some trash routes are an easy walk around
town while others entail heavy lifting and arduous work. Weber noted one worker has schizophrenia and
twitches as he works.
“Maybe others might exclude him, but we just keep on working,” she said. “I also have some people who are
still hard into their addiction, but for the time they are working, they are sober and interacting and feeling
good. Our folks run the gambit of age and disability.”
As the team moved from one block to the other, they ran into Steve Schaff, 54, who has picked up work with
Ground Score in the past. He yelled from his bike: “Hey, is that Ground Score?” and Weber yelled back, telling
him she had him down on her worker list and would be calling him soon. Another man passed by and asked
her if she had a business card – he was interested in work too. [image: ground score]
Terry Blaka picks up trash as part of the city of Portland's partnership with Ground Score.
“(The program) gave me structure,” Schaff said. “It really has helped our homeless community, and it gave me
something that I had to be on time for on a certain day and time.”
Weber said she is continually floored at the impact the program has provided to individuals camping along
the street. Some are physically disabled and have a hard time cleaning their tent area on their own.
When campers saw the team approach Monday, they began cleaning up their own spaces and walked bags
of trash over to the red wagons. Weber offered them fresh garbage bags in exchange.
“Thank you, appreciate you,” one man said as the team carted his garbage away.

appeared to be trash but said everything else is fair game. Blaka, one of the workers, noCtereda ttheat he has
learned a lot about the community in the past couple months: “I’ve learned how to interact with people,
especially when asking people if we can clean up their spaces. It’s people’s foundations we are talking about,
it’s all they got.”
Smith said the block that he calls home has improved since the trash team has started making regular rounds.
By the end of the Monday shift, the team had filled five bags with 90 pounds of trash, a metric they measure
with small handheld scales from which they hang each trash bag to check its heft.
“What they do, it helps take the heat and stress off,” Smith said. “Some people who were living in tents
nearby were swept because their areas were really messy. This helps us keep our area clean. I really do
appreciate what they do.”

If SOLVE spent $400,000 to pay locals to clean, instead of spending $400,000 on advertising - yes.

If multnomah county said, here is an extra $2 million - and here is how you have to use it - yes
Solve has been around for the past 52 years - they have had plenty of time to establish programs that

MarsArtist •5y ago
To avoid the cobra effect, the city may want to consider a two-tiered work program, with cleanup paying
slightly less than, say, planting flowers in the parks.
Crews could start with trash cleanup, then as the city's trash problem abates, workers get a raise as they shift
to beautifying parks. This higher paying work would be available only when street trash is below a certain
threshold.
Without some incentive to have a clean city, we risk intentional trash dumping to ensure job security,
increased work hours, or by those who wish to help the less fortunate.

$20/hour?!
thats more than my partner makes...
-1
StarryC •5y ago
I would guess that your partner's job might still be "better." It does not appear that Ground Score work
would provide 40 hours a week at $20/hour, or even reliably 20 hours a week. It does not seem to provide
health insurance or room for advancement. Additionally, the job is picking up trash outside. That is not
the most pleasant job for everyone. And, it also appears that it is a "program" so there is a limit to the
number of people hired and that may be based on need v. qualifications. My guess is very few workers
gross more than $320/week.
So, I could say, SSDI is $1,300 a month! I know someone working who makes less than that. Yes, because
SSDI is a benefit program based on need, not a job. Or, I know a doctor that makes $400 an hour to do
consults! But, there is only 1 hour of such work available per week. Neither is quite the same as a job
making $X/hour with reliably 36-40 hours a week and employer benefits.
But, if your partner makes less than $20/hour, does work less enjoyable to them than picking up trash
outside, gets less hours of work on a consistent basis than 20 per week, has no other employee benefits,
and has no room for advancement, maybe your partner should find a new job?
Portland Public is hiring custodians for full-time jobs at $16.21 per hour, with paid holidays, medical
dental, vision and PERS benefits, paid sick leave and PTO. This seems to be a similar job which would
provide a better life long term than working for Ground Score if our partner is reliable and can pass a
background check.
