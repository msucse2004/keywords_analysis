Props to the couch/mattress pile in my NE 90th neighborhood getting cleaned today!

Why did it take so long?
From the "related story"
The city also said that they cannot collect the items because a person lives in a tent among the trash
and the items are his personal property.

This pile of trash is what homeless advocates refer to when they say "homeless don't want to go to
shelters because they can't bring their property in as well"

But I NEED those old tires and broken baby strollers and 100 petco stuffed unicorns 🦄.

Ok but really, this is something I’ve also noticed. Where’s the source of all the stuffed animals? 🤔

Oof, that does sound complicated. Then again, when does it stop becoming someone's property and start
becoming a half-block-wide pile of actual trash that gets in the way of other residents?

ETA: At least the cops didn't get too involved, I guess?

Tyler had some good ideas
One piece at a time, like in the Johnny Cash song.

He ended up with just one thing at the end, though.
I guess a pile could be considered one thing.

Multiple trucks, and crews over at least two days to clean this spot and the city thought it hadn't reached a
bad enough level yet when they were originally trying to rationalize leaving it be. Like what? Article states the
man living there was apparently arrested. I hope he can get the help he needs, but seems doubtful given our
current system.

He was arrested for punching a woman in the face who was attempting to take a picture of the mess he
created. He should get charged with assault and intentional pollution, no sympathy from me. Other
people are homeless without causing rat infestations and attacking people, keep him locked up for a
while if he wants to act like that.

Shout out to kgw for bringing attention to this and making the city do something. People on 160th and
Burnside live in the city just as much as the people in the pearl or Alameda.

The City That Works! Please note, it will require one year, a physical assault and a local TV news segment for
us to formally address any unlicensed waste disposal facilities in your neighborhood.

Imagine trying to house a horder like that.... you'd have a tsunami of garbage on your hands within days. And
it would severely degrade the quality of life of neighbors. I don't know what the solution is.

Do you get the disease from the pooping, or does the disease cause the pooping

"With the trash cleanup, neighbors feel the area will not only look better for potential renters..."
It's pretty telling that these "neighbors" apparently spoke about "potential renters" instead of their existing,
rent-paying neighbors. Because screw the people who already live there, I guess?

Some wires go left. Some go right. Some don't go at all. Oddball shifting layers vibrate. The firmness of the
tire and the steel shelf. Fine glass fibers and filaments, growing. Tendrils through the rust and the rush and
the family. Chirps. Some cement, rat friends.
A cave of solitude, small creatures shiver and piss. The captain of an eighty four foot ship, a sea of roiling
plastic and melting detritus. No jetsam, everything floats up here.
The rubbling scrapes on the tent. Nostalgia among the settling mass, a killing lullaby, a blanket and his
ablutions, never quite asleep, Gary remembers his submariner days, Ensign! 43 years ago, 34 straight days
undersea, 43 ableseamen, 34 mates, 43 white glove inspections. 34 passes.
Finally the helm. A periscope. TOTAL CONTROL.
Gary surveys the ship. Calm, scratching at the decks. Aluminum salts. And the brain throbbing rats needle and
shift, always listening for the next order.
