Homeless services advocates argue that those additional officers cause unhoused Portlanders who live
downtown to be over-policed.
Yes, clearly overpoliced. Can't even pitch your tent in the middle of a busy shopping street without getting

Quite a nice racket the city has set up , businesses pay them to get a license to pay for their own security.
