glad to know that complaining on tripadvisor is the best way to communicate with our elected officials

We all should all write a strongly worded review of Portland on Tripadvisor!

And of course Hardesty was against it, Wheeler and Ryan cited TripAdvisor and NextDoor in their support of
it. What a fucking disaster we have running this city.

If we care about tourism income, it seems like citing tourism review sites might be reasonable?
9
PDeXtra •4y ago
Right? Why would you poll locals (outside of local businesses that rely on tourist activity) for evidence
about tourism?
2
[deleted] •4y ago
If you want evidence about tourism you can find better sources of information than TripAdvisor.
If you want to cherry pick reviews to support your position, there you go.
People are motivated more by out-group animus and fighting than they are about a city council
member basically using a online comment section to justify policy.
They going to cite Yelp reviews next to decide which restaurants to bail out?

PDeXtra •4y ago
a city council member basically using a online comment section to justify policy.
I mean, if you really think this is all they used to justify the policy, I'm not sure what to tell you.
Political messaging is aimed at normies, not activists or wonks. Most everyone who travels
knows about travel review and ratings sites, and has likely used some version of them when
deciding on their own travel. It's a shorthand for a lot of other numbers and metrics I'm sure
they have in hand.
Is it the best messaging? Probably not. But it's not at all as confounding as y'all are making it
out to be.

What exactly was the alternative? I get that Clean and Safe is an extension of PBA, but look at this city. I
remember working downtown in Old Town years ago when it wasn’t as bad and every once and a while there
was human shit at the front door street entrance, and someone would call Clean and Safe, and they’d come
deal. Without that I don’t know how coworkers would have dealt with it then and I certainly don’t know how
they’d deal with it now.

rosecitytransit •4y ago
Part of the issue isn't Clean and Safe itself, but how it's structured and oversight.
5
[deleted] •4y ago
Correct. The city itself and downtown business are paying into Clean and Safe, which contracts with
the Portland Business Alliance (the Chamber of Commerce). Funds from C&S pay salaries at the PBA.
The PBA, the city auditor’s report found, had violated lobbying rules ~25 times. The PBA admits to 1
or 2 times.
So the question is, why are Portland businesses and taxpayers funding lobbying?

I don’t know exactly how effective this program has been. I live downtown but I don’t know what cleanup (to
the extent there is any) is the result of Clean and Safe.
I also am conflicted about downtown property owners having to pay for this. On the one hand, I do like the
concept that if a neighborhood wants extra resources that neighborhood specifically must contribute more
for that. On the other hand, a relatively safe and clean neighborhood should just be part of the deal wherever
you are.

This is my problem with user fees. We pay extra for what should be included in what we already pay and it
allows the city to spend money on a bunch of BS pet projects rather than focusing on core services.

Fratpilot •4y ago
Agreed 100% Portland wastes enough of my tax dollars paying people to do nothing. They can spare
the money to at least do the bare minimum and allow me to walk down the street without stepping in
human feces or on an aids needle without charging extra money.

35 organizations in support of hardestys proposal penned a letter stating:
“An equitable, inclusive public process with collaborative outreach—especially to our most marginalized
community members—is the only way to generate the informed, quality input we need to plan for a
prosperous and revitalized Portland we can all be proud of.”
I’m actually laughing out loud at this. This is the type of shit I comment on this sub to make fun of these
people and I’m not even joking, it reads exactly like my comments. Got all the trigger words, absolutely no
substance, no call to action, no ideas, all posturing, all virtue signaling, no attempt to create buy in from
opposition. This is liberal grifting at its finest where if you say the right words in the right order you literally
don’t have to do anything and can collect a paycheck while this city fucking rots. Lol

Part of the issue with this program has nothing to do with the things you’re complaining about.
The city of Portland also pays into C&S. Money from C&S pays salaries at the Portland Business Alliance,
which the city auditor found was breaking lobbying rules.
The city has little oversight over these enhanced service districts and the funding is murky at best.
So, as much as we want to make fun of the language and the touchy-feely nonsense, there are issues with
the structure of the program. City Council decided to not worry about it.
People on this sub don’t give a shit so long as they can dunk on progressives. Zzzzzzzz

Its unfortunate that businesses have to pay extra for this but is completely ridiculous that anyone would
oppose it if they are willing to pay for the service. It is necessary given the state of downtown and blows my
mind that Hardesty would oppose it. She needs to go - she is on the wrong side of every issue and actively
tries to make Portland shittier and more dangerous.

It’s not about the program, it’s about how it is funded and where that money is going.
The city itself also pays Clean & Safe money for their service, and that money is paying salaries at the
Portland Business Alliance (the chamber of commerce). The city auditor found that the PBA was breaking
rules on lobbying.
So… the city just ignored the auditor and didn’t do anything to clarify or rectify any of that.
r/Portland cheers. Bad governance fuck yeah!

Consider that your average citizen cares a hell of a lot more about having a safer, cleaner downtown
than they do about technocratic lobbying laws.

“The fact our local government allows any private entity to patrol, control and dominate public
space seriously undermines the ability for all community members to exist in our sidewalks, streets,
parks and plazas, which are supposedly open and accessible to all,” said a statement by Stop the
Sweeps
Yes, it is definitely extremely problematic when private entities, like people with massive tents and chop
shops, dominate public sidewalks and parks to the exclusion of the general public. Those people should
be cited and made to move their private belongings out of the public right of way.
Stop the Sweeps inadvertently made a great point, they just need to take it to its logical conclusion to
figure out why the general public doesn't agree with their actions.
