I think we need to talk about the PCEF (Portland Clean Energy Fund)
Edit: TL;dr - Fund that is well intentioned (the idea itself is a good one) is collecting way more money than
expected - like infrastructure funding amounts of money, and seems to lack direction, oversight, and certainly
communications/PR about what that money is for. It's so much money.
In light of discussions around firefighters needing money for leaky roofs, city workers being underpaid, and such -
and a general backlash to the innumerable pet-taxes this city has enacted, I think it's high time we discuss the
massive ~$200 million dollar elephant in the room. The PCEF.
The voters of this city approved the tax for the "clean energy fund" without a defined use for the funds and
without a proper analysis of collections and revenue impact. This thing had no defined objective, it just said "fund
clean energy stuff and we'll try to do it in a way that uplifts communities." Sounds nice but what does that mean!? I
work with the energy industry, I have no idea what that means.
Well it seemed pretty obvious that would turn into a slush fund with ample opportunity for grift, while essential
services are fighting for table scraps. This is now one of the single largest revenue generating tax programs in
the city and it has ***no defined goals or purpose (***I should probably so, no clearly defined - "grants" aren't
defined) at this stage. You could replace the Burnside bridge with these revenues in short order.
Well, guess what:

Ok, well maybe this nebulous miasma is torpedoing some proven actual progressive policy, but I'm sure they've got
big plans. Plans that align with their nine figure war chest and mandate: - Portland City Council votes to fund

Air conditioners. We're buying air conditioners. Listen, we need air conditioners for poor people I agree but they
have nothing do with clean energy. They increase the use of natural gas, the opposite of clean energy. We are
repurposing this thing into a slush fund for adjacent programs because they have no way to spend the
amount of money they are collecting without a clearer mandate and without potentially being impacted by
massive fraud.
Listen, I'm for clean energy, I'm for investing in marginalized communities, of course. But this thing is collecting a
fire hose of cash, without clear oversight, without a clear mandate, while our city workers beg for raises. What is
the plan. I would be happy to be wrong, so if someone has the answer here step in please, and while you're at it,
get on TV and explain it to the voters.
Just for a little insight into what $170 million can buy if it's not sitting in bank account:

It seems like the reasonable policy would be to do a cost-benefit analysis to find the most money-efficient
way to reduce Portland's contribution to climate change without degrading quality of life and invest in that,
whatever it is. (I include the "quality of life" clause because we could drastically reduce carbon emissions in
Portland by constructing a cement wall across all lanes of HW26 at some point, but that would make a lot of
people very unhappy.)
It's kind of a weird amount of money, because it's a lot compared to other things, but in terms of
decarbonizing a city it wouldn't go very far. We could replace a lot of diesel buses and garbage trucks with
electric, I suppose.
I agree that any fund like this ought to have clear goals and criteria for investing in things.

I'm an environmental economist, and I just bang my head against a wall every time I see left wing climate
activists oppose revenue neutral carbon taxes that force industry to become more efficient whilst providing
tax relief, because the activists think it's "too conservative" and demand the tax revenue be put into clean
energy slush funds.
This post by OP highlights is why said government administered funds aren't a good idea! It's much more
efficient when you just change the incentives for companies so they can create the most efficient carbon
reduction strategy, because business is a lot more competent than government!
350.org even opposed I-732 in Washington in 2016 because of that anti-revenue neutrality sentiment.
All that unspent funds like this do is create potential for corruption and waste, and hurt sentiment towards
cleantech.

My social circle in Portland consists of well-meaning people who consider supporting increased taxes the
extent of their civic duty. They are the sort that the phrase "Portlanders have never met tax they didn't like"
describes. What I find fascinating is these same people have no interest in understanding how their taxes are
utilized. They typically have very little idea of which government entities provide which services, and how
much those services cost to provide.

Everyone in this city seems to think that mandatory tax uses enacted with new tax somehow justify tax
increases and are a logical way for a city to budget its programs. It's not! A cannabis tax doesn't have to
fund drug treatment. A parks fee doesn't need to fund environmental nonprofits. And when we narrowly
limit the way that tax funds can be spent we tie the city council's hands on being able to allocate funds to
where they are needed. I don't mind reasonable tax increases but I never vote for this shit because it's a
ridiculous way to manage public funds.

It doesn't really matter when they're convinced that the root causes are all vague, shadowy concepts
many times larger than the concerns of our little city. Take "the 1%" for example. I'm pretty sure no
billionaires were harmed by the passage of PCEF, but it's the thought that counts, right? Surprise, the
problem doesn't go away because it's far outside the reach of a narcissistic mid-sized west coast city
who can barely manage its own problems let alone tackle national, global issues. So the New Thing
gets passed, fizzles, and is forgotten. Shockingly, billionaires still exist in a year or two when they next
slush fund is proposed. Rinse and repeat.

It's complicated.
In 1980, energy efficiency became law in the NW for public utilities. Around 2000+- the Oregon legislature
required efficiency for private utilities. Much of the private utility energy efficiency money flows through the
Energy Trust of Oregon. That is required energy efficiency money from Pacific Power and Portland General
Electric.
The Energy Trust prioritizes incentives based on technical studies by the NPCC. They can tell you down to the
penny based on science how much insulating your attic, a heat pump, or better windows will save in energy
over 20+ years.
In 2018, an Energy Trust board member resigned
https://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2018/08/30/22546239/outgoing-energy-trust-of-oregon-
board-member-cites-racism-in-resignation-letter. That created the PCEF opening.
Meanwhile now Commissioner Hardesty was hired to promote the PCEF initiative by signing endorsing
organizations. One theory would be the large number of endorsers did not want to alienate the promoter. No
local retail business wants to be against clean energy or Hardesty. In order to get more support urban
farming was included.
The flaw of PCEF is it is not tied to the most measured-to-be-valuable-by-science efficiency projects, and it
has no measurements of the program.
The other factor at work is the the public employee unions desperately want a sales tax as part of the
revenues that pay them. It is edging in in the form of the Corporate Activity Tax on revenues. It is called a VAT
in other countries. That was negotiated by Portland Public Schools Board Member Julia Brimm, ex-Nike, which
has its own special tax treatment. The PCEF tax is also a sales tax, on revenues, like a VAT. I think there have
been more, and I would expect more.
The problem with sales taxes is that they are regressive. Even with exemptions on food and drugs, they are
regressive, meaning low income individuals and families pay a larger percent of income. It doesn't matter that

the state you came from to here that it is not regressive. It is not a good taxation system, unless your
Skip to main content
objective is to reward public sector employees at the expense of poor people. Create
Where PCEF should go is an ordinance by Council to measure new employees hired from grants for the long
term, prioritize projects by measured efficiency, and public metrics every six months.
Installing insulation, weather sealing, installing HVAC and water heaters, doing blower door studies/energy
audits, and mounting solar panels are good trades. Better trades are HVAC service, union electricians &
plumbers, and installing windows and doors.
Installing roof gardens on yoga studios? Nope. That is not a career job that can support a family.

Three percent of the power in New England, on average, is produced by burning trash ("refuse"). this is
considered renewable (?).

So, the city could use this money to fund refuse collection, which our city has no shortage of, burn it for
power generation, and call it clean energy like NE does.

There have been so many things like this on the ballot in the past 5 years. They all pass. Well, except for
Measure 97, which sounded like one of the more useful ones. I am absolutely not anti-tax or low-tax for the
sake of low-tax. I just firmly believe we need to prioritize our issues and fund them accordingly. There have
been so many shocks being a (democrat) voter in Portland. There seems to be little to no plan for so many
measures and incredibly little investigative journalism about what they really mean.
This is such an inconsequential example, but the numbers and stats for the library bond were wildly
(purposefully?) manipulated to make their case for needing a new flagship in Gresham. It’s fine to propose a
bond, but so unethical to manipulate statistics. I only figured this out by reading the data on the library’s

website. Basically…to say that East Portland has the lowest amount of library square footage…they took the

largest library(Central in SW downtown)…divided its square footage and assigned to SWC,r NeaWte and (west of
82nd) NE and SE. They assigned 0 to anything east of 82nd. In reality, if I can recall, the 2nd and 3rd largest
libraries are east of 82nd. Just weird shit like this.
I wish we could just have a fund and prioritize our needs and spend there. Instead it seems like we have a
dozen or so half-assed, inefficient, pet projects/slush funds.

This tax was proposed and passed at sort of the height of the "1%er" rhetoric politically/nationally and
they ran on that - "1% from the 1%." That was the big discussion right before COVID. FWIW I could not
agree more that there's major issues with wealth distribution in this nation, but that's not what we're
discussing here, factually. In reality it was for any local business with revenue over $500k and national
over $1 billion.
The latter may involve the 1% but the former almost certainly does not (uniformly anyway) and this 1%
receipts tax is a real burden on locally owned businesses taken with all the other new taxes they're paying
of late.
But it was a perfect storm for Portland - tax the "rich", fight climate change, money for marginalized
communities, etc - all the big hitters. So it passed with flying colors. They never went as far as laying out
an actual plan though and apparently didn't need to.
1% doesn't sound like a lot. It's a lot.

Oregon leaves casinos to the regional tribes. Every nearby tribal group would love to have a casino in
Downtown, but every nearby casino is terrified of potential lost business should a Downtown casino be
created. Perhaps the environmental solution is to allow non-tribal entities to own and operate casinos in
Portland.

Oh please. Could we divert some of this money for siting & maintaining garbage cans/dumpsters around the
city? Because while it’s laudable to aspire to people generating less trash (reason cited for less frequent trash
pick up) it’s clearly not working out that way. The reality is people are dumping trash every where & it’s
ruining the city. If some of this $$ could go toward restoring Portland’s beauty (perhaps with an element of
providing/creating livable wage jobs for folks struggling to get back into the work force) they would be
brilliant!

Just want to reiterate that I don't think the people behind this are ill intentioned, but I think it's hard for
people let alone governments to turn down or be too upset about a huge windfall. Although I think they
should be - more money more problems and large pools of funds are a huge liability. That's where oversight
comes in (which does not abound in Portland government.) I think in light of the amount of money this thing
is generating - while we're facing semi-austerity elsewhere - it begs the question, what's the plan here? Use it
or lose it as they say, and is the scale of the revenues appropriate?
