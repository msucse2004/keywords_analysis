“The fund would just months later earn negative headlines when it awarded more than $11 million to a
nonprofit whose leader had spent years in prison for defrauding energy companies.”

Here is how Oregon Live reported on the PCEF's objectives:
"For example, auditors found the program has yet to formally adopt a way of measuring, tracking
and reporting the performance of projects that it funds, which officials say are expected to
surpass 100 later this year."
"Nor has it finalized a system to track and report that money it hands out matches the share of
funding required: 40% to 60% for renewable energy or energy efficiency; 20% to 25% for clean
energy jobs; 10% to 15% for green infrastructure and regenerative agriculture; and 5% for
innovation."
You will notice that there is no specific requirement here to fund climate equity projects. This is
the only context in which the initial Oregon Live story mentioned equity:
"Meanwhile, a required workforce and contractor equity plan with the aim of training and hiring
people from historically disadvantaged communities remains incomplete, according to the
report."
https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/03/portland-clean-energy-program-not-accountable-
for-climate-or-equity-results-audit-finds.html
Perhaps City Hall's general policy of promoting racial justice in all the city does has caused the
PCEF to overlay racial justice goals on all four categories of projects.

The auditor’s initial findings elicited fierce pushback from clean energy officials, who believed auditors
had unfairly held the emerging program to a standard fit for a fully operational one. Doing so in the
final audit would ultimately damage the program intended primarily to help city’s communities of
color, insisted its manager, Sam Baraso.
Got it. So not having any standards for performance metrics is the solution here. Also, it seems like to me the
only people who damaged the program intended primarily to help the local communities of color were the
people running the program. This audit wouldn’t have been “blatantly racist.” It would have reflected the
baffling incompetence of the people running the clean energy fund.

“(Andrea Durbin) also said the report underplayed the fact that the fund was technically still in its “start-

years.”
If the program got a two-year extension already, why is it that Carmen Rubio said it’s goals still won’t be
released until July 2023?
Wouldn’t goals be the first thing to establish before awarding multi-million contracts to convicted con
artists and handing out six-figure grants for a feasibility study the feasibility of a rooftop herb garden at a

So not having any standards for performance metrics is the solution here.
I will disclose that I haven't read the actual article or audit, but this also isn't what the quote you've
posted here says. It doesn't say no standards is what is correct, it says that the standards for a fully
operational, all kinks worked out program are not fair to apply to a new program that is trying to get up
and running. And I would say that's fair. Lots of businesses do that. New locations often take time to get
up to the efficiency and production of older locations that have been able to work out all of their specific
locations idiosyncrasies. That doesn't seem unreasonable for a public program either, and to me that is
what the quote you've posted is asking for. Appropriate standards, not no standards.

She also said the report underplayed the fact that the fund was technically still in its “start-up

They’ve had close to four years to get this together. At what point is something no longer a “start-
up”? Ten years? I worked in government contracting so I am well aware of pitfalls and setbacks but
this whole organization is a bad look from top to bottom with management screaming racism, to
nonexistent due diligence, to causing an audit to go 8 months due to pushing back on virtually every
piece of feedback, and getting to claim the “start-up” branding throughout the whole process.

I don't think you understand the logic of the argument. The comment wasn't only on the
quote, devoid of any context. They quoted that line to mock it as a bad faith argument,
exposing its actual meaning.
You assumed it was a good faith argument and protested that it wasn't being taken seriously -
- which, of course, is true. You also seemed to read "any standards" as literal which is bizarre.

PersnickityPenguin •4y ago
The article didn't state there would be no standards... it sounded like a softening of language for political

And two rather *huge* examples of this are set to debut this year (in what will be a rude surprise
for many on April 18th) in the form of SHS and Pre-k taxes. In theory there's going to be millions
rolling in from each, but nobody's bothered to ask how it will be measured or audited. If this is
any template, I don't have high hopes.
Before anyone dumps on me for playing a violin for "the rich", I'm not really against the concept
of the tax itself (and muahaha for not making enough to make it my issue I guess?). What I am
against is this series of hamfisted implementations coupled with "how dare you ask us to provide
metrics" when criticized.
If you're going to tax peoples' money, everyone should have a right to see how it is being spent
(and be able to hold those in charge accountable), whether it's some Doctor's $2000 SHS tax bill
he'll find out he didn't pay on April 18th, or my $35 Arts Tax I continually wish I could pay in
pennies.

I've said it before and I still think this. This program is entirely a cover for city officials who don't want to make
the hard decisions to address the climate crisis. Communities of color have very little power to reduce city
emissions or mitigate for the coming climate changes, and it doesn't matter how much money you give to
non-profits to do that. This is a job the city should be doing. Instead, they are attempting to dodge their
responsibilities.
I wish I hadn't voted for this thing.
Edit: Thinking about it a little more, maybe it isn't fair to blame city officials since they didn't put it on the
ballot. It is still, I think, a fundamentally flawed program.

Non-profits are more mismanaged then our local governments. I work in middle market banking(entities
with millions of dollars of income), and non-profits are the worst. Only 5%-10% of their budgets go
towards actually helping people. The rest goes to administrative costs and salary costs. The worst part is
that the governments give massive grants to non-profits to fix these social-economic issues, but these
problems never get fixed because only 5% of the budget actually goes towards fixing the problem.

I’m talking specifically from my experience. I haven’t analyzed the financial statements for every
nonprofit out there. But the ones I have analyzed were pretty eye opening of the efficiency of the
nonprofits. I think it’s pretty telling that nonprofits don’t make their financial statements public,
making it so there is zero accountability for them. Governments’s financial statements are public,
but when they give grants to nonprofits we aren’t able to see or analyze the effectiveness of our
tax dollars because it is being hidden by non-profits. All we know is X amount of dollars was given
to these nonprofits, but we don’t know how that money was specifically used or or how effective
it was

That's one of the things I was curious on. While I am all for small/local non-profits doing good work,
it seems like we take large sums of money that COULD be impactful, and piecemeal them out in the
name of equity. Then, rather than having one pool of funds to support an objective, we've got loads
of non-profits that are not held accountable for what they do.

I'm not sure what you're getting at. One of this program's stated intentions is to help
"communities of color."
In keeping with that mission, most of the program’s employees and nearly all
members of the volunteer committee that recommends grantees are people of color.
This is what I'm referring to.

Your comment(that I cannot see so sorry if I mess up) was that "communities of color have
little power in the climate crisis" My point is no one really had much power no matter the
community they live in.
And yes yet again the city is messing something up. Either your goal is addressing the
climate crisis or helping those of color. It is unlikely one specific program can do
both.hiring people based on race isn't likely the answer.

It is definitely not one or the other. If we don't do anything about the climate crisis,
communities of color (although really, we should say economically disadvantaged
communities and whole countries) will be hit the hardest by consequences of climate
change. My point is that the people in power, who need to make the necessary
changes, are doing their damnedest to avoid that responsibility.
It sounds like we probably agree generally, but you are misunderstanding something

Portland. 99% invisible had a good episode on shade a couple years ago. There is some work the city

The initiative was designed by Jo Ann Hardesty as a consultant while she was running to be Commissioner.
There was not much focus in the initiative on measurement. It gathered a successful set of nonprofit
endorsers.
The committee they ended up with was inexperienced, though earnest. The bureau management did not
sufficiently focus them.
Portland is one of the top cities in the world for clean energy and efficiency expertise. It has dozens of
nonprofits focused on underserved communities. What could have been done is to use existing expertise in
one set of nonprofits to create enduring energy programs within another set.
The job program has a good nonprofit, but that program is much too tentative and small.

Yes. Different nonprofits have different objectives, and different nonprofits are more efficient in
measurably accomplishing those objectives.
Some nonprofits are policy groups without people helping measurement. Some are self employment
agencies. That can be a good thing, for instance employing and managing formerly homeless
individuals. Some are pass through regranting agencies, like United Way. I think that is the segment
you are referencing for regranting ratio.
Nonprofits are just a segment of business entities. Some are well managed, some are not. Some for

A huge part of the problem is that liberals in Portland have become the party of neoliberal paternalism.
People don’t want to invest their own time and energy towards fixing a problem. We just want to pay taxes —
or more accurately, we want the “wealthy” (aka anybody richer than me) to pay the taxes — and hope the
problem goes away. That way we can feel like we’re doing our part while not actually doing a goddamn thing.
These voters rubber stamping every feel-good ballot measure that gives the city government more money
are the same voters that hate literally everybody in the city government by the way.
Just as an example, take a look at any of the SOLVE trash pickup posts. There is almost always somebody
there to say “The city should be picking up the trash!” Like. Why?! We have a functional volunteer
organization that produces real results and it consists of citizens getting actively involved in the betterment
of their community. And you’d rather see the city government do the job instead? No thanks.
