From article…
“Diversifying Energy’s executive director, Linda Woodley, had served time in prison for defrauding energy
companies and racked up millions of dollars in liens for unpaid federal and state taxes, including an
$800,000 penalty filed earlier this year.”
YIKES!! Not a good candidate to give 12 million to.

Thanks! Was hoping to find a free source.

I love the part where staffers recommended the company be refused. Nope, your due diligence is no good
here.

This is an excerpt from the November 9, 2021, memo to the Portland Clean Energy Fund (PCEF) Committee
from the PCEF Staff. The subject was: "PCEF heat response grant program, equipment purchasing partner RFP
recommendation." It is one of the sources linked to in the Oregonian's coverage of the story.
It summarizes part of the process that led to the approval of the proposal that has since been rescinded as a
result of the discovery of adverse information about Linda Woodley.
"The Equipment Purchasing Partner RFP was open for two weeks from October 13 – 27. The compressed
timeframe was driven by the need to have a partner recommended by the PCEF Committee and approved by
City Council by mid-November to begin sourcing portable heat pump/cooling units for initial distribution
beginning in spring 2022. A public information session was held via zoom on October 19, and responses to
questions were posted online on October 22."
"Two applications were received, from Diversifying Energy and Earth Advantage, and subsequently reviewed
by a majority Black and majority woman panel from the following teams in the Bureau of Planning &
Sustainability: • PCEF (1 staff member) • Equity and community engagement (1 staff member) • Smart cities (1
staff member)" (Emphasis added.)
Does anyone know whether the Bureau of Planning & Sustainability has rules that mandate the racial
and/sexual makeup of panels such as the one mentioned in the preceding paragraph?

So just a bit of insight here…PCEF (Portland Clean Energy Fund) specifically funds projects that benefit
BIPOC, Low-Income, and marginalized populations (women, gay, trans, etc). So the people on their panel
to approve how that big bucket of money is spent are representative of those populations (so that’s why
it’s a majority Black & Female).

That’s slightly disturbing and weird, figuring clean energy has diddly squat to do with race and gender…
am I missing something here?

Historically disadvantaged, historically victims of being forced to live in areas that have more
pollution, the woman part is just popular politics at the moment.
It’s important to remember that you have to think like them: EVERYTHING is political. A straw, a rock,
a cloud.

The thing is identity politics doesn’t do anything, it creates a larger divide. We need to stop the

overarching destructive policies of the donor class. To raise the tide to help Cevreearyteone.

Well, this is a group of people trying to help everyone.

Nope, they are specifically trying to help BIPOC & marginalized communities. I know this
b/c I just wrote & turned in a half a million dollar grant to them a few weeks ago. I can
upload the grant application if you want - but it asks you specifically to account for which
of these populations your proposal will benefit.

Also, on a 3 person panel 2 is a majority. Why is this an issue? I assume you wouldn’t have commented if
all 3 were white males?

As the ED of a 501c-3 I can tell you the scrutiny we are under is 10x that of a “normal” business.
