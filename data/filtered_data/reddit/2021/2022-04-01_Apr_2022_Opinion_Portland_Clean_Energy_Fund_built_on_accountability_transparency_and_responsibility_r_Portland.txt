“Portlanders should be proud of this program.” And yet…

“much like other start-up enterprises aimed at making positive change.”
YOU ARE USING TAX PAYER FUNDS. You aren’t a daring, privately funded start-up. These people’s heads are
so far up…

Is this an opinion piece on OregonLive from the Commissioner and Project manager about their own work?
Don't they have a Portland Gov webspace for this?
This has to make the top 10 in word counts for saying nothing. It feels like maybe they got in some audit
trouble, or that they don't want to follow the audit. People are mad at them about too much equity? Man I
don't know what I just read but I'm not reading that a 2nd time.

And we look forward to seeing this program’s stated goals in July 2023.

I'd really look forward to the whole program going away. Shoppers at WalMart, Target, Winco, and Fred
Meyer would benefit more from paying 1% less on their purchases than the purported benefits claimed

This is some of the most aggressively inane word salad I've read in recent memory
Its like 6 paragraphs that say nothing at all.
Then mentions an auditors report that they're making nonspecific changes to address the non specific
complaints
Then a paragraph that basically says 'just kidding' and that they're going to continue business as usual
regardless.
I know bullshit when I see it, and this is some USDA prime.

Any start up would star with goals, objective and metrics. They are operating without them? Rubio is
completely clueless. Why did she fire the Director of the program after the audit if everything is going so
well?

As someone who has worked in the community for a long time, restorative justice is a value I believe
in. Time and again we’ve seen how our justice system can be a barrier to someone’s ability to make
changes and reestablish their life. However, even through this lens, and after giving Ms. Woodley the
opportunity to respond, there remain concerning inconsistencies that call into question Diversifying
Energy’s ability to get lifesaving cooling units to vulnerable Portlanders.
This thing is one big slush fund and has zero accountability and transparency. Rubio and the PCEF almost
gave $11.5 million to a convicted fraudster because she was of the correct demographic. Luckily the
Oregonian caught it before it happened. No apology from Rubio, in fact she even tried to blame Linda
Woodley's convictions and misdeed on an unjust criminal justice system. What a joke. This program needs to
be sunsetted.

There is a similar full court press contorted denialist thinking puff piece over at the Mercury.

This can be a good program but it is not. The commissioner needs to step in and micromanage the program
until it is actually, measurably working well, and is seen to be working well.

Unfortunately it's Carmen Rubio. She will just make excuses for the poor performance. The whole thing is
just one big slush fund. Let's return the cash to the taxpayers.

Man, supporting something flawed/failed even though it comes from the "correct" ideology, and shitting
on something that works if it comes from the "wrong" ideology is so *off brand* for the Mercury, this is
super surprising! /s

That article at least has some details.
Personally, as someone who cant afford to be a homeowner in this city, I find the idea of the city blowing
800k to help 20 homeowners increase their property value fucking insulting.
I'm sorry, if you can afford a home in portland you aren't "low income" or "disadvantaged" no matter
what color your skin is.

Opinion: repurpose the money towards universal sidewalks for the city and expanded tree cover in East
Portland. Those are the most effective ways Portland could respond to the climate crisis.

I don't know if I have ever agreed with you on here before, but this is the best suggestion I have seen
about what to do with the money.
There is so much that could be done (especially for East Portland) and instead the fund is being used in
some highly questionable, inefficient, and physically irresponsible ways.
