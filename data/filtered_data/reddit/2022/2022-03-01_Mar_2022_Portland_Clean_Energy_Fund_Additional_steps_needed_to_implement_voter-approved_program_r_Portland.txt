This program stalling out and receiving such bad coverage is really sad. Its a first in the nation style program.
Especially after the heat waves this program should be installing heat-pumps (efficient ac) and insulation all
over the city. It has so much money. Is there another narrative around this program that isn't getting told?
This is Hardesty's baby, why is she letting it languish.

This is Hardesty's baby, why is she letting it languish.
Hopefully Hardesty's campaign opponents will ask the same question only more publicly and more
pointedly. It's in keeping with Hardesty's failure to get the new police oversight organization up and
running. If confronted, Hardesty is likely to toss out a woke word-salad's worth of excuses.

According to the story, Commissioner Carmen Rubio is responsible for this program. It's yet another
example of the weakness of Portland's current system of city government. Her CV in no way qualifies
her for the task:
"Carmen began her career of serving others in the offices of Multnomah County Commissioner
Serena Cruz, Portland Mayor Tom Potter, and Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish. She served as a
policy advisor and worked to engage Portlanders on critical issues. In each of those roles, Carmen was
known for her dedication to making local government more accessible and more responsive to all of
our communities—making Portland work for everyone."
"In 2009, Carmen was tapped as the executive director of Latino Network, a small organization that
advocated for Portland's growing Latinx community. Over the decade that followed, she grew Latino
Network’s team to 140 talented people who spent their time lifting up youth and families to achieve
their potential and define their futures. Various community-centered programs engage parents,
support early literacy and high school completion, focus on youth and families impacted by the
justice system, and provide energy and rent assistance to those in need of support. The organization
also helps families navigate our country’s system of immigration."

If you look in the audit they mention that they need more staff to administer the program. The program
was hamstrung with a small administrative budget.

More staff? They almost gave $11.5 million to a known fraudster. A simple background check or even
a 30 second google search would have revealed that. More staff? How about staff with even a
smidgen of fiduciary responsibility for taxpayer funds.

Sounds like a job for another committee!

Probably, that’s how government gets input from the communities that will be effected by a decision, and
people with specific technical knowledge needed to guide decisions.

How about repurpose the money towards universal sidewalks and increased tree cover for east and north
Portland? That would be the most efficient way to mitigate the climate crisis at the local level. Send it to the
ballot for November.

Hey there, the pandemic has slowed things down, but Friends of Trees plants them free. Portland Parks
gives them away free. You can mitigate the climate crisis (and stop shootings) for free!
Sidewalks are a LID because the original developers were cheap.

Unfortunate side note is that Friends of Trees stopped planting street trees for this year (and maybe
future?). They’re only doing private trees.

The city stopped funding Friends of Trees. Guess they weren’t woke enough.

Cool, we could plant a whole lot more with public funding. Create
Sidewalks should be publicly funded just like roads. It would be insane to expect homeowners to fund
a road privately, why should a sidewalk be any different?

Per City charter and City code, property owners are responsible for constructing, maintaining, and
repairing the sidewalks abutting their property (Portland City Code & Charter 17.28.020)
It comes back to slacker Multnomah County in East County. Multnomah County did not require
cheap ass builders to build sidewalks and sewers in East County. When it was annexed by the City
of Portland, the city forced the homeowners to put in sanitary sewers because of the endangered
salmon. The City did not force the property owners to put in sidewalks.
PBOT has the miles of unpaved roads and streets without sidewalks and there is a budgetary
number per mile. PBOT has maps on their website of unpaved roads, and places with no
sidewalks.
From direct experience, builders build the road, curbs, and sidewalks in new development.
Probably they build the main line sewers, storm and sanitary. Not sure who builds the main water
line for new developments. Once those are built, the City maintains the road pavement, and main
water/sewer lines. The City does not maintain the sidewalk or street trees.
It is a common misconception that the City is going to pay for it.

And I vehemently OPPOSE that policy and I am advocating to change it. Sidewalks should be
the responsibility of the city, no different from how we treat public roads. Stop making
pedestrians second class citizens.

They shouldn't have to: it shouldn't be the responsibility of the private market to build basic
infrastructure. Again, apply this policy to roads, it would be universally opposed. Sidewalks
should be treated ni different.

My position is pave ALL the roads and build out universal sidewalks.
The City does not maintain the sidewalk or street trees.
The city SHOULD. I am literally advocating for a long overdue policy change.
It is a common misconception that the City is going to pay for it.
Opposition == lack of understanding. I completely oppose the current system and I am
advocating to change it. Stop trying to make pedestrian safety a back burner for corporate
profit.

Good luck with your quest!

Right there with you. For the amount of money they're pulling in every year we could have the 2030 bike
Plan actually built out by 2030. That'd do a lot for the climate. PBOT already has goals and metrics of
success in place, they prioritize pedestrians, bikes, and transit before automobiles, and they need an
ongoing source of funding that isn't tied to gasoline or parking. Give it to them.
