More than three years after its launch, a voter-enacted city of Portland program tasked with bankrolling clean energy projects and jobs has yet to set performance standards, finalize accountability systems or launch an equity plan, all required under its design.
Those are among the findings of a city audit of the Portland clean energy program released Thursday. It also raised concerns about how the program aligns with the city’s climate goals and the absence of clear oversight for spending.
The string of structural and administrative shortcomings has persisted for years even as the program has begun to distribute millions of dollars and holds more than $170 million in its coffers, according to the City Auditor’s Office.
