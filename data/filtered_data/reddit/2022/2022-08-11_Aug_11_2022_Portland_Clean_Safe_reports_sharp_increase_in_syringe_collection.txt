PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Some organizations tasked with cleaning up downtown Portland say the number of needles theyʼre finding is
increasing exponentially.
Just in the past ʼ21-ʼ22 fiscal year, Downtown Portland Clean & Safe collected more than 180,000 syringes in the downtown corridor, and while
they say a lot are still found in the streets and public areas, it appears more people are using the safe syringe deposit boxes placed around
town.

From thousands of bags of trash picked up to cleaning graffiti tags, Clean & Safe has been busy this past year, especially when it comes to
collecting used needles. While they still see plenty in gutters and sidewalks, much of those needles are coming from safe syringe drop boxes in
downtown hot spots like Bud Clark Commons and 4th and Davis.

“A sizeable and notable increase in the needles found in the safe deposit boxes which is good in that people are utilizing those which is what we
want. We want to eliminate as much as possible, especially uncapped needles in the public right-of-way,” said Mark Wells, executive director of
Downtown Portland Clean & Safe. “Last month, roughly, we had about 4,000 that we picked up on the street that were loose, and that can be a
single needle or sometimes weʼll get a call from a business, and theyʼll have four or five or 15 needles in one spot. And I think we had about
15,000 needles just last month from those four boxes.”
But when it comes to those needles, Clean & Safe numbers show an exponential change in recent years, going from less than 5,000 needles
collected in 2014 to more than 180,000 this past year. Itʼs something Wells attributes to the opioid crisis.
The organization works alongside other government entities like Multnomah County, which says the big jump between mid-2020 and 2021
could be due to a COVID-safe change in their syringe program, going away from one-used-for-one-clean transaction to multiples at a time, to
dissuade crowds and people lining up close together.

Going beyond the areas covered by Clean & Safe, Toevs says theyʼve seen a decrease in people coming in for needles, likely signaling a change
in the substances users are opting for — but theyʼre still collecting hundreds of thousands of syringes from the area.
“We have had a slight decrease in the number of folks that are visiting us recently,” said Toevs. “I think there is a little bit of a shift right now in
drug use and drug availability and people are smoking their drugs rather than injecting.”
Even as these clean-up efforts like needle deposit boxes are shown to work, Wells says itʼs impossible to ignore the greater issue.

“I think you can look at Clean & Safeʼs statistics as kind of a barometer for livability and challenges that weʼre seeing in our social services,
mental health crisis,” said Wells. “I think itʼs just really being honest with ourselves and saying we have a very severe drug problem. We have
individuals that need reliable and timely access to drug treatment.”
In addition to sterile syringes and new sharps containers, Multnomah Countyʼs syringe exchange program also provides overdose kits, safe sex
supplies and referrals to mental and medical care and substance treatment centers. They hope providing these resources can reduce the risk of
public health issues like the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C.
