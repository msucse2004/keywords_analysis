I’ve been interested in this since seeing the dramatic reversal in the news a couple months ago. My honest
question is: what specifically is the City supposed to do here?
It seems like the City very likely overstepped its legal authority under state law when it originally denied the
LUCS. Zenith filed a lawsuit, and the City reversed its positions. Realistically, is the response from the City
spending lots of time and money fighting a (likely) losing battle in court?

I believe the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals upheld Portland’s right to deny the LUCS

LUBA told the City they had the authority to deny, but to try again with a stronger basis for doing so.

terminal-but-more-evidence-needed
Court of Appeals also said City has the authority, ruling on Zenith’s lawsuit, and Zenith appealed to
State Supreme Court.
Riverkeeper has a decent summary of the current situation, along with recommended actions, here:

Tyler had some good ideas
The LUCS allows Zenith to continue bringing oil trains into Portland. In exchange, Zenith
promised to stop hauling crude oil, and transition to “renewable” fuels, within five years
The City’s denial of the 2021 LUCS is not effective unless the City re-adopts that denial
after providing more evidence that Zenith’s operations violate City policy. Zenith could
challenge the City’s new evidence and continue running oil trains while courts heard the

case. That process could take a year or more. And if Zenith won that appeal, Zenith could

continue shipping crude oil indefinitely, instead of stopping after five yCearersa.te
So it sounds like the city is calling this a compromise that avoids indefinite oil shipments. I don't
like that it was done without public process, and I'm skeptical about what constitutes renewable
fuels in this context

Awesome, thanks for sharing. This is useful information. It looks like one of the Riverkeeper’s
recommended actions to help is to contact all city commissioners!

Yeah but they aren’t clear about what they want. It’s implied that reopening the LUCS to a
public process could give the City leverage to extract more concessions from Zenith. This
comes with delays and legal risk, and means the facility would keep operating under its old
permit. But the City got concessions as part of issuing the LUCS, gets to enforce them now
and going forward, and there’s a 5-year cycle for review.

They should continue to reject the project. The project is still bad for the environment and has multiple
safety issues regardless of what state bureaucrats say.
Oregon also now has a governor who is likely much more sympathetic towards rejecting this proposal.

In practice this means the facility operates under its old permit, and the legal fight continues, which
the City might lose, doesn’t it?
The governor’s involvement is what? Appointing different Supreme Court judges?
I’m all for making companies bear the cost of their externalities. It seems like the City got some
concessions here, and now the strategy should be new laws and ordinances so the next time the
permit needs to be renewed there’s a firmer legal basis for the findings and decision to deny.

No, we shouldn't be caving to fossil fuel companies with how severe the climate crisis has gotten
and how loosely regulated hazardous cargo on freight trains is. There was just a major derailment
in Ohio, we do not want that in Portland.

Thank you. That’s a fair answer to my question.

I think it should be a state law. Could be persuaded by the new governor.
I have been behind the scenes, the gop has been funding candidates to get open oil drilling off the
oregon coast for decades. Which is a colossal bad idea, because of the cascade subduction zone, not
withstanding. Imagine a earthquake/tsunami and massive oil leak…yikes.
We need to be smart with our energy future, (slightly off topic) we should be drilling for Geo thermal,
(oregon has lots of potential) and using that power to sequester co2 like they are doing in Iceland.
You can make money off of power and the airline industry by taking energy credits..to make them
carbon neutral.
Also the by product is giant hot tubs with swim up bars…which I personally dig.

Multnomah County found shipping crude oil by rail poses significant risks to human health and property.
You can contact Commissioner Rubio to oppose granting Zenith a Land Use Compatibility Statement (LUCS).
Sample Text for Letter or Email to Commissioner:
Dear Commissioner Rubio:
I am writing to you to request you revoke the Land Use Compatibility Statement for Zenith Energy. The
Multnomah County Office of Sustainability found that shipping crude oil by rail poses significant risks to
people, public health, and property. Notably, they found:
“Most oil is currently carried in outdated tank cars prone to puncture, spills, and fires in train accidents.
108 schools and 100 childcare facilities are within the evacuation zone.
Over $25 billion dollars of improved property is within a half-mile of rail lines in Multnomah County.
Emergency responders do not have adequate equipment to respond to a large-scale OBR event.”
Allowing the transport of oil by rail is simply not worth the significant risk. Thank you for your time and for
your consideration of this important issue.
Sincerely,

It is ridiculous that Portland is even considering this awful project. What happened to the city and state
climate goals? What about the earthquake vulnerabilities? What about the possibility of a derailment (this just
happened in Ohio)?
Society shouldn't be oriented entirely around maximum profit for a couple of oligarchs.

Zenith is a legal business that pays taxes, they also get government services.

They get government services like roads. They don't get the right to pollute the environment and
endanger the residents of this city.

Clearly, since the City has denied their permit change.
