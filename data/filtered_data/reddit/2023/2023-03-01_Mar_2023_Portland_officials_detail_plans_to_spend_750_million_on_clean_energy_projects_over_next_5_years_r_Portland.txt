Another $95 million would be earmarked to expand Portland’s tree canopy, promote and provide
access to electric bicycles and fund transportation decarbonization projects.
Good stuff.

I care about the environment. I mean my whole family gets around by bike, trimet or EV. This shit is important
to me.
At the same time Portland has to stop this performative bullshit. Our schools are failing, homelessness is out
of control, we have no services to deal with mental health or addiction and our police are useless. Maybe
focus resources on any of those things? I mean take your pick.

All of those are real problems that need attention, funding, and solutions, but the funding discussed in

the article was approved by voters specifically for this use. It would set a pretty concCerrenainteg precedent if
the city decided to use the funding for anything outside of the measure as passed by voters.

The paywall is keeping me from reading the exact details of the plan, but I would absolutely classify
making Portland a resilient city in the era of climate chaos to be just as important as many of the issues
you raise.
It’s all interconnected, at the end of the day

It's performative in the sense that Portland can not execute on really basic shit right now like filling
potholes, providing affordable housing, providing basic health services or getting the police force to
do...anything.
We are essentially expanding the mandate of an arguably failed city (a bit of hyperbole there, but not
much). I care about these climate issues, but I don't much see the point of dumping money on the
latest trendy climate initiatives when we can't support our existing infrastructure.
Two examples come to mind that emphasizes this point. First, we dumped a bunch of money into the
new Division rapid buses and bus stops. But, a hell of a lot of people don't feel particularly safe on
trimet due to lack of enforcement (so ridership is way down) and we have to spend a shit ton on
fixing busted ass bus stops due to the perpetual vandalism.
Second example: Bike ridership. We have more bike infrastructure than ever before, but biking in this
city is WAY down. Why? No traffic enforcement. Rampant speeding, running red lights and people
obviously driving under the influence. There's no point to adding to the infrastructure if there is no
one at PPB who cares enough to protect vulnerable road users.
I'd argue (not even a argument really, just a fact) that we would be way greener as a city if we actually
took steps to fix the things that are broken rather than build a bunch of new stuff and hope for the
best.

The state House just passed 200 million for housing and homelessness initiatives. Money is finally starting
to trickle from measure 110 for addiction treatment and is definitely something Kotek and politicians
have targeted. The police suck and not sure about the schools, but we can't keep repeating the same
things when institutions are actively working on them. It just looks like you're either not paying attention
or have some sort of political axe to grind.

I'd say that it's because I have been in this city for 15 years and have been close to politics my entire
life.
This initiative is kind of like a realtor trying to sell you a gutted meth house by pointing out the solar
panels that they just installed. We should fix the house, but that takes a hell of a lot of work, so
instead we are going to sell you on the popular shiny new thing and sweep everything else under the
proverbial rug.
I would have loved this initiative 15 years ago when our city was functional. Now it just looks like one
more reason for the city to avoid buckling down and doing the hard work that will actually make this
place livable again.
The obvious answer here is that we do both. Do both this new initiative and fix all of the things that
fell apart during the pandemic. But that requires the city to walk and chew gum at the same time, at a
time where you have to be incredibly (and naively) optimistic to believe that the city can even do one
thing at a time, let alone 2.

None of that will mean anything unless we quadruple our inpatient psychiatric beds and reevaluate
our involuntary psychiatric confinement rules.
There used to be State mental hospitals in every county with a major population center in Oregon.

EDIT: On the bike front, it does look like we're getting $20 million for ebike (both cargo and regular) rebates

Yes, considering transportation emissions are the top category of emissions that can be altered by good
local/regional policy, the more we do on this front the better.

Hey that's only a little more than we're spending on a single apartment block for low income housing!
Edit: I read the number wrong, still holds true that the entire project is corrupt.
There's mass corruption in the government around the Fairfield apartments renovation.
"The project’s costs are very high: Gold and his partners finished a 112-unit project in East Portland last year
at a total cost of $302 a square foot. City-subsidized housing on the eastside is more expensive but getting
built for under $500 a square foot. Gold says the city ought to be counting every penny: “There is no excuse
for spending that type of money for an SRO product when you could build complete apartments for half the
cost or less.”
Fairfield will be $1,300 per square foot.
You explain why it costs almost triple.

Hmmm, which one is more? $750 million or $36 million? HMMMM HAVING TO THINK REAL HARD

Also, you purposely chose an article that does not fully discuss the renovations needed, and
misrepresents the transaction.

Fairfield is going to see a massive structural upgrades cost. Throw in replumbing and rewiring the entire

upgrades, the price is not unreasonable.
Additionally, the city transferred the building, the $36m goes to outside contractors to perform the
renovations. It's not $36m for the building alone, and then the rest of the costs.
This is some serious astroturf shit you got going on.

"WW ran those numbers by housing experts. Although most declined to comment for the record, the
experts, to a person, found the expense extraordinary."

$36 million to outside contractors who almost certainly have connections to sitting officials. Zero
reason why it should cost that much.

So what you're saying is there's no reason why they should be renovating instead of just building
from scratch. Weird.
Who's the astroturf?

They want to preserve the appearance and makeup of a historical building. That is part of the
cost.
The Eastside you can just roll in, wreck it, rebuild it. Of course that will be cheaper than having to
work with very specific constraints of not modifying the outside appearance and non-living
spaces too much, while still making it livable in modern times.
WW should have consulted both housing experts and historical restoration/renovation experts.
Together, you would likely get a much clearer picture on why the expense is so high.

Maybe... maybe we shouldn't use historic buildings for public subsidized housing projects if
we can house 4x the people for the same money.

Yes, poor people shouldn't live in this neighborhood... Nevermind that The Fairfield has
been subsidized SRO housing for decades. It's been public housing for a very long time
and hasn't been invested in for also a very long time so there's quite a lot of work to just
bring it up to current building codes. Add historic requirements and seismic retrofits and
of course it going to be expensive. What's the other option? Don't invest in the building
and let it rot in the downtown core? Renovate it into luxury apartments and send the
poors off to the Eastside where we can build cheap?

This is a total non sequitur. The cost of the project you're complaining about is, according to the article
you shared, 36 million or about 1/20th of what's being spent on these clean energy projects.

It's actually super urgent, just as urgent as street repair, even though it's less visible than potholes in

If we completely decarbonized 100% of Oregon’s emissions, it would do nothing on a global
scale from a climate change perspective. If we don’t all do it as a unified country it’s just a
shell game. Would much rather have city and community investments. I mean, it’s getting
pretty bad out there…

We are just as responsible as anyone else, and the US is one of the worst offenders in
terms of emissions per person. Yes, we need funding for clean energy across the country
and the world, but it's foolish to oppose it on any level or to write it off as vanity projects.
Our energy infrastructure is important. It's important we start working on changing it now

There's no good future. But there are better and worse ones. If everything

The fun thing about people who spout your flavor of bullshit nihilist perspective is
that we can all hoist you upon your own petard and oppose any spending you

you can just take a long walk into a lake and leave the decisions to the rest of us
who would like to at least try.
