Energy Assistance
News
Just a reminder that energy assistance is available for Portlanders (and all Oregonians) with a household gross
annual income at or below 60% state median income (SMI). Income guidelines are at the link below:
https://www.oregon.gov/ohcs/energy-weatherization/pages/utility-bill-payment-assistance.aspx
If you qualify, click on the link below to find more information about how to receive help paying your power bill.
This assistance is available to homeowners and renters, regardless of heat source. Even those without proof of
income can qualify with a little extra paperwork.

I just got my first power bill of the year and it was a doosie! Luckily I can afford the payment, but for those who
can't, help is available. Stay warm and safe out there!

I’ve tried so many times to access public assistance to help pay my electric bill, and they’re never accepting
new applications for assistance. You might have better luck with a social worker or case managers help in
accessing those funds. Otherwise, good luck.

I just applied for it through the PGE website last month and I got approved!

Same here. Applying was a cinch. Took them around a month to process my app, and I get a 20%
discount now. Anything helps.

Did you need any documents other than pay stubs and ID?

On the online form all I did was provide my monthly income. They didn't ask for any further
documentation (which I have in case they ever do ask).
I simply heard back via email (and also snail mail) about a month later stating that I qualified
and would receive a specific discount.

Yeah, that's been my experience. I lived elsewhere in Oregon and never had a problem getting energy
assistance, but in Portland it's split all over the place and you have to find the agency that you qualify for.
And then there are no appointments available. I did apply to PGE for their Income Qualified Discount and
get 25% off, which helps some.

Is it still 211? I used to work for them and it was a struggle during Covid times since everything is done
over the phone including questions regarding sensitive info and sending photos of identification.
Needless to say, I get cussed at a lot, and its not their fault. I hope those people got the help they need
though.

So it’s welfare for PGE and their rate hike and internal bonuses.
How is this better than a PUD??

It needs to change… has anyone heard anything from current or potential future political figures talking
about turning PGE into a PUD? Anyone? Bueller?

First we need to organize the city or cities of PGE (similar thing is happening with city of San Francisco
vs PG&E) to make a bid. Worked well in the island of Kauai.
Second if bid is denied we put an initiative for the state, then state regulators figure a fair market
price, then the public votes.
Private utilities spend up to $40 million on the campaign to persuade voters to not vote for it.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.
If interested. I would ask the city at drama filled public hearings.
For state PUD. https://www.opuda.org

I applied and my household was approved for 20% off…right before PGE raised residential rates 18%.
Because our current income is laughable, I asked a rep how low it would need to be to qualify for the 60%
max discount.
$3k.

So do apply, but don’t expect much.

That makes no sense.How would anyone even have an ongoing bill making only 3k a year?!

Right? Like at that little income WTF would they even be running the power into?!? I think it’s one of
those programs to make shitlibs think the poor are lazy. See, they can get 60% off their power bills
even! Can we really though? Like I’m sure PGE gets a fat tax write-off, so the program’s not JUST
decorative…

All 15% off PGE bill does is to remove the increase this year / keep the amount same as last year.

Almost! Almost covers the 18% rate hike 😬

I don't get a power bill, my landlord's management company bills me for it, minus the share he pays because
he lives in the ADU. That makes assistance a problem, which is a bummer.
