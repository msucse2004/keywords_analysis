Here's an article about the CEI hub where the oil storage is occurring

So city officials helped this massively polluting company with a long history of safety and emissions violations
lobby for approval of dangerous oil storage projects by using private coms in order to avoid public records
requests, deleted their communications, and then advised them on how to avoid public criticism after being
taken on a private boat tour.
Very cooool. Can we revoke the permits based on this bullshit?

Wait, where does it say they used private email accounts? Is that from a different article? And avoid public
criticism? It talks about a tour of the facilities but I must've missed that part.
Also, some comments below are talking about Wheeler but he's not even mentioned a single time in
here, and the only quote that casts a positive light on Eudaly's actions is from an anonymous former
staffer of hers so like of course they would say that.
Anyway, I don't think Zenith is good, and a renewable fuel hub is sort of dumb because everything is just
going to electrify anyway. But also these storage facilities already exist all up and down the Willamette
and Columbia (and entire west coast), so the idea that this is the one thing that is going to fuck us in an
earthquake is also dumb.

The OLCC stories and all were good, but this seems downright sinister in terms of the scope and reveal of the
story.

Love that an article that blatantly proves our councils corruption is buried under the everyday measure 110
bad & homeless bad posts.
What environmental credentials can Portland even boast? It's pathetic.

Stupid eudaly with her progressive policies not licking the buttholes of the polluting industry, I'm glad our
current city council fixed that /s

Eudaly can be right on one issue and absolute flaming dogshit on literally everything else.

I think she was right on a lot of things and was willing to try things. The second part is why we are
stuck with Ted Wheeler. People reward doing nothing instead of someone trying things and
sometimes getting it wrong. Personally I think we need to try some things instead of sitting on funds
and talking.
For example I think she was right to reduce the power of neighborhood groups as the groups are not
really representative of the neighborhoods and instead of representative of a small subset of the
neighborhood with strong opinions and time on their hands.

Yeah. This is also the thing that she got crucified for which is pretty messed up.

My dude, if you think "I don't think Eudaly did a good job" and "I think Mingus Mapps does a
good job" are in some way obligatorily tied together, you've lost your god damn mind.

Nobody knows, because nobody knows who "Dingus Dapps" is.

The one issue she was right about was proposing a ton of bus-only lanes, but yeah, she was dogshit
on literally everything else.

So you don't think she was right back in 2019 opposing the crude oil terminal Zenith's planning?

Ah, I forgot that a broken clock is right *twice* a day! But yes, this too.
Interestingly enough, this Street Roots article quotes a staffer who "can't remember" if Eudaly
turned down an invitation to tour the Zenith facility, yet a contemporaneous Mercury article
highlights Eudaly was very vocal about this at the time, leading me to believe the staffer's
memory/claims aren't all that reliable as to the particulars.
In any event, it all certainly stinks! The jobs and money aren't worth it considering the
environmental risk.

Agreed. I'm sure someone thinks moving to biodiesel is the lesser evil when compared to
fossil fuel and it's trying to make what improvement they feel they can get, but that shit
isn't worth it at that potential cost.
