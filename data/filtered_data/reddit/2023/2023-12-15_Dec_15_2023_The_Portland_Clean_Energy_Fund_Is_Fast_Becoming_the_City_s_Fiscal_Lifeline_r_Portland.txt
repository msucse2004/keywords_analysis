Prop 65
“about half of the newly-projected funds will go to cash-strapped city bureaus for work addressing climate
change.”
I bet they are going to get really creative with what constitutes work addressing climate change.

Not really, just so happens there is a ton of decarbonization work that needs to be done and up to this
point, with PCEF formerly restricted to community orgs, there was no clear way to pay. PBOT for instance
is going broke since gas taxes and parking fees are stagnate, yet the bureau can make the largest climate
impact of any bureau or org in the city. So this forecasting windfall is great. It’s going to fund climate
projects like bike infrastructure, streetcar expansion, electric fleet, LED streetlights, etc while not forcing
the city to divert general fund to bail them out. Similar story for other bureaus with many climate projects
but financial woes/no clear financing.

Where are LED streetlights left. The city took out a loan and replaced them all years ago.

The City completed the LED conversion, but PBOT still gets a $7 million general fund allocation
annually for signal/lighting replacement and reconstruction that need to meet efficiency
standards. A lot if it being Vision Zero related projects that adds more lighting at high risk

Yeah what work are they doing to justify their paychecks? Probably bullet points on a report with feel
good buzz words.

hire street sweepers, waterway clean up crews and tow truck drivers
and boom, you just fixed a bunch of the pollution going on in the public space.

1% sales tax on purchases provides significant gov funding. Next up: water is wet.

When you pay taxes the government has more money than when there were less taxes

That’s some serious spin. The projects meet the criteria of the CEF, because if they didn’t the folks paying the

A garden on top of a yoga studio met the guidelines of the CEF. It's a ballot measure we voted on in PDX.
As usual, not very well written.
