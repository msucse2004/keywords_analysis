Since it was sold as "not a sales tax" to voters (even though it absolutely was) - what I am most curious is
which if any companies are adding it post-sale as a direct to consumer sales tax and then failing to pay
because that would be the most insulting.

The idea that we'd tax companies on revenue and they wouldn't just turn around and increase prices by
the same percentage always felt pretty silly. Like someone at Walmart went "Oh snap that pesky Portland
finally figured us out. Guess we have to pay taxes out of our profit margin now"

Hmmm… I wonder who paid for the anti DA Schmidt billboards, but is not paying their taxes.

I donate $20 whenever you complain about People for Portland and I haven't filed my 2023 taxes yet, so
it's me. You're describing me.

$40! This kicker is massive so I’m happy to spend some (in advance) on a cause I support. Any
organization that wants a clean and safe city for businesses is also getting me a clean and safe
city for my family. Thanks for the reminder, happy Monday Funday :)

You could pay their taxes. Feel free to vote for anyone, but be aware as anyone you could be
being bamboozled by them.
