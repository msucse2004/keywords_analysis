a violation” of the Unfair Trade Practices Act.
I'm normally opposed to hidden fees, but how the hell did the judge arrive at this decision? The tax allows
retailers to pass along the cost and doesn't require it to be itemized, so there's no code violation. They're not
legally required to include the cost in the price of goods
Not including in the price of goods? Has the judge never been to a state with a sales tax?

So based on the article it sounds like there are two different rule sets that are at odds.
The city of Portland said: "Go ahead and itemize the tax on the receipt" which is what WinCo did.
But at the State of Oregon Level the Unlawful Trade Practices Act says you can't "[misrepresent] the credit
availability or nature of a transaction or obligation incurred by the customer;"
So even though the city said it was fine, by not including the 1% fee in the price it could have been a
violation of the Unlawful Trade Practices Act. I imagine it also may have worked if they had posted signs
around the store letting customers know that for some items a 1% tax may be included. Essentially, the
customer shouldn't find out after they pay, it should be clear and up front before payment is rendered.
I'm not a lawyer though so this is just my interpretation as a layperson.
Has the judge never been to a state with a sales tax?
I mean since we don't have a sales tax our laws, especially at the state level, may not be compatible with
how other states do things.

This is bizarre. Shouldn’t citizens already expect a sales tax that they voted for?
Winco charged their intended price. Portland added their 1% tax, as requested by voters. It was itemized
as required by the measure.
I would be livid if I were Winco

How very Portland. First pass a sales tax, then sue because the tax isn’t hidden from view by a higher shelf

Bro, please don't chase Winco out of Portland. They are the only groceries I can afford.

Thankfully their Loss Prevention guys don’t play around. They take shoplifting seriously so hopefully
they’ll be ok.

Maybe they should post it separate from the receipt, similar to how taxes (country, state, city tax) are
posted at a gas station?

What kind of "news" is this? It explains nothing. Here's the entire article:
"WinCo will pay $3.6 million to settle a class action suit that alleged the company misled thousands of
customers into paying hidden surcharges on certain non-grocery goods.
The settlement was reached during mediation before Oregon Senior Judge Henry Kantor and follows an $8.8
million payout from Safeway to settle a similar case."

You only get a snippet if you're not a subscriber or otherwise able to hop over the paywall.
It seems like bullshit. The woman who started the suit works for a legal firm and began it over ten cents,
and the law explicitly states retailers “may separately itemize its (Clean Energy Surcharge) obligations on
its invoices to its customers to whatever extent it chooses.’’

follows an $8.8 million payout from Safeway to settle a similar case.
Portland customers who bought non-grocery items from WinCo after Nov. 25, 2018, and who
submit timely claims are anticipated to receive $200 each. Any unclaimed money will be donated
to nonprofits in Oregon that help consumers, under the negotiated settlement.
The named plaintiff, Virginia Simonin, visited WinCo’s store at Southeast 79th Avenue and Powell
Boulevard on Nov. 23, 2019, and only after she had gone through checkout and examined her
receipt did she realize that she had paid a 10-cent surcharge, according to her lawyer Michael
Fuller.
The suit alleged WinCo engaged in unlawful trade practices and unlawful enrichment for failing to
advertise the true cost of goods it sold.
WinCo, in response, admitted it disclosed to its customers a 1% Clean Energy surcharge on certain
products by itemizing the surcharge on customer receipts. But the company said the city of
Portland authorized it and other retailers to itemize the surcharge on receipts.
“WinCo did not willfully use or employ a method, act or practice declared unlawful under Oregon’s
Unlawful Trade Practices Act,” wrote John C. Clarke, one of WinCo’s lawyers, in court papers.
The store’s lawyers argued that WinCo “made no attempt to conceal the charge; rather, it fully
disclosed the charge on Plaintiff’s receipt as suggested by the City’s rule.” Plaintiff's WinCo receipt,
November 2019 The named plaintiff, Virginia Simonin, said she had visited WinCo’s store at
Southeast 79th Avenue and Powell Boulevard, on Nov. 23, 2019, and only after she had gone
through checkout and examined this receipt did she realize that she had paid a 10 cent surcharge
on the non grocery items she bought.
In November 2018, Portland voters passed a ballot measure establishing a grant program known
as the Portland Clean Energy Fund. The program is designed to fund green energy initiatives from
a 1% surcharge on sales by large retail businesses that generate more than $1 billion a year in
national revenue and $500,000 in annual revenue in Portland. The program exempts basic
groceries and health care services.
In 2019, the city adopted rules governing the Clean Energy Fund that provided that a large retailer
“may separately itemize its (Clean Energy Surcharge) obligations on its invoices to its customers to
whatever extent it chooses.’’
Yet a federal judge denied WinCo’s motion to dismiss the suit in 2020.
U.S. Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta found that even though neither Portland’s City Code nor its
Business Tax Administrative Rule required retailers to itemize the Clean Energy Surcharge in a
specific way, WinCo “was required to accurately advertise the price it intended to charge”
customers for non-grocery goods.
Not including the surcharge in the retailer’s advertised price of goods, Acosta found, “could
constitute a violation” of the Unfair Trade Practices Act.
Portland’s cash-rich fund that aims to bankroll clean energy projects and jobs could see a
staggering $540 million in unexpected revenue in the next five years, according to the latest city
forecast.
Last May, Safeway agreed to pay up to $8.75 million to settle a class action lawsuit over
allegations that the grocer also improperly passed the Portland clean energy tax on to shoppers.

This doesn't make sense. I've not been here long, but I figured this sort of thing is allowed to let us pay for a
cleaner energy option. I could be entirely wrong, but I'm not sure how they won that.

Wonder if this is outside Portland proper too?

No. It’s a Portland-specific sales tax. If you want to avoid it, all you have to do is shop outside the city
limits.

I wonder why all the businesses aren't suing the city because the city is not using that money as it's being
taxed for. They're funding the bureaus with it. Create
I keep thinking about a house that the water bureau built and got sued for.
