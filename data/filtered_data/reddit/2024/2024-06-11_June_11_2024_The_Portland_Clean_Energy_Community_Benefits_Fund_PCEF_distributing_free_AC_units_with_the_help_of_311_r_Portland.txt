Not sure how I feel about a clean energy fund installing the least energy efficient A/C units available.

While I agree, there’s merit in the the cheeped model making into home that may become hazardous this
summer due to climate change. In a way it’s mitigation of the effects, potentially lifesaving. Not a perfect
vision but going in a good direction.
Now, we iterate and improve, ideally.
If there’s waste in the program then that’s bad, but this seems tactically sound to me assuming
renewables are simutaniously developed.

Like it’s just assumed they’re handing out single hose portables. Wish there was an option to select that I

have a normal window and want the efficiency gains of a window unit. Create
Or better yet, why can’t they make this work as a voucher system with local retailers.
I’d happily throw $100-200 on top of whatever their costs are to secure an inverter window unit that is
quieter, much more efficient, and actually going to last many cooling seasons.
As it stands this is just going to pump crappy units out hat will break easily and cost a fortune to operate.

Ugh, come on. Surely there are some competent people at PCEF who could have suggested a better use of
their funds than distributing thousands of the worst possible hvac solutions out there. There are more
effective, lower-GWP units that won't have pfas refrigerants while consuming a fraction of the energy of these
things. If they're going to increase energy consumption and grid load with an AC program, at least they could
try to live up to their name.

If you divide the amount of units by the cost, it’s staggering. Just look for yourself, our government is
incompetent. Looking forward to more rate hikes on utilities, that should help people with overheating and
freezing to death. ☠

16million program to deliver 15,000 units. That puts these units at 1066 a pop. They sell for around
$350 max at your local Home Depot.

They aren't just handing out the AC units though. They're installing, which might involve
additional equipment not to mention time/knowledge.
