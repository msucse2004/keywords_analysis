Thoughts on PCEF (Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fun)
Discussion
I’m doing research on some neighborhood projects and I’m learning more about PCEF and how it became bigger
than it ever expected to be due to the Covid crisis. Does anyone have any thoughts on how PCEF funds are being
handled? From what I’m finding, it’s seeming like it can be pretty iffy at times.

If you sold anything on Black Friday, buckle up for the January chargeback
nightmare. Spoiler: "Item not received" claims spike 30-60 days post-
purchase. Stop them with pre-dispute alerts before filing.

They have really only done one round of funding and are now proposing an overhaul of the program, so a
small sample size and track record. There’s nothing else like it in the country.

What do you mean by "pretty iffy at times?" "Iffy" in terms of their own processes, how funds are allocated,
how funded organizations are spending funds, etc?

They're probably referencing the $100,000 spent on a rooftop garden for a yoga studio. That seemed
pretty BS.

Looks like it was $100,000 to spend planning a rooftop garden for that yoga studio. Any luck locating
the results of the planning grant? I'm now genuinely curious as to what came from it.

I’m talking about how they seem to be pretty loose and putting grants in categories that don’t really
match up

For some of the awards, I can see it. I'm really curious about that rooftop garden and its actual
outcomes. I took a quick look on Google Maps and I don't see anything on the roof.
