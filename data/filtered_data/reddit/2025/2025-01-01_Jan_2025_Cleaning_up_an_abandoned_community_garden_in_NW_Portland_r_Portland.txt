up. it’s a shame. i hope the city/whoever is responsible will reopen it so those of us in the neighborhood
can reclaim it and make it beautiful again.

I have a plot at another community garden sending an email now. Hopefully we can get it cleaned and up
and running. Is this a city of Portland community garden? Do you have the cross streets?

City of Portland responded: Hi there,
Thank you for your email. Our program does not own or operate a garden at that location.
Our program has several gardens in SW Portland and plans to open a new garden in about 2
