The auditor is being pretty clear that we now have 12 full time council members with no other job
responsibilities. If they want something investigated that is their job to investigate it. That is what we are
paying them for.

They are trying to stay neutral is why. Please remember Dan Ryan and Carmen Rubio went on a day tour
of zenith’s work and a fancy paid lunch (bribe) at a nice restaurant and got flack for that 4 years ago.

Regardless it is not the job of the Auditors office to investigate what the council wants investigated.
That is the whole point of having an \independent/ auditor. The council should be doing their own
work.

No it is not at all. an ombudsman position is created to deal with complaints from regular
people/customers not leaders of an organization. Regular people need extra help but people
in charge can do it directly. The council can investigate it themselves or pay for an outside
audit.
An independent auditor or ombudsman should as a principle never take requests for
leadership since leadership could just fill up all their time preventing them from doing their
actual role.

An Ombudsman is supposed to see longterm. Zenith is fucking terrible long term.
That’s why it was a request, not a requirement from the city council.

And that is why the auditor politely told the council they are idiots who don't
understand the system. The point of the auditors office is to bring things to the
attention of the mayor and council. It is now already part of their attention and now
their job. The whole point is for the auditor to not work for the council or work on
what the council already is focused on.

So we as the public should write a letter to the city auditor to look into zenith. Do
you think it will then look into zenith?

This is crazy: stop investing in fossil fuel infrastructure especially when there is a big risk of a fiery derailment.

To be fair, they applied to put an underground pipeline so they wouldn’t have to use trains and
negate all fire risks, but they environmentalists fought against that. It’s almost like environmentalists
don’t actually care about residents safety, and just use it as a means to their end

actually concerned about safety. That’s why they’ve opposed plans to mCarkeea ttheings safer,

maybe it's because there's no safe way for the site to exist in the location it is currently
in...
https://multco.us/info/cei-hub-seismic-risk-analysis
anyways, without the "environmentalists" you dislike so much pushing back against fossil
fuel companies, corporations wouldn't have the intrinsic motivation to attempt to join the
energy transition. maybe at this point in the climate crisis we should be challenging the
right to exist of fossil fuel companies rather than holding their hands as they provide false
safety solutions

I get it, it’s the ombudsman, but an ombudsman is supposed to look out into the future and guide the city.
Zenith has continuously lied, and has put the city at risks of bomb trains.
Can the ombudsman tell me what is the value of human life of dying from a bomb train, of potential polluting
the Willamette, and the fire safety of burning forest park?
This ombudsman is not doing her job, she will eventually need to be voted out.

Alternatively, the LUCS process actually is a relatively straightforward administrative procedure and all this
uproar is because people are mad that the city followed its rules.

people are mad that the city gets to freely give a permit to a company that has had a history of lying
and going back on commitments that they need to make to reduce harm to citizens and the local
environment. the whole reason we have a representative city council is to change the way the
government functions and give citizens more of a say on decisions that will affect them.

As such, it should be treated as a political issue by the city council, because the rules were very
clearly followed, and we don't need to have the city auditor waste their time doing what is
flagrantly a political witch hunt against the company.

So we are in agreement, the city council should be addressing this, not the auditor.

And yet....
Do you have a gas stove or gas water heater? Is your vehicle an EV yet?
Ultimately, the companies are responding to consumer demand. If you want to eliminate
those companies, go after the consumer demand. Going after the companies does jack
shit as long as demand is necessary.

consumer demand is overwhelmingly trending towards heat pumps, evs, and
renewable energy. but consumer demand would be a ludicrous reason to say we
should keep using fossil fuels anyway

Keeping the lights on in the hospitals, the trucks carrying food running, and
homes warm is what's most important.
It's why cleantech is a transition, not an instant one-day shift.

Zenith takes in crude oil and tar sands from Canada and North Dakota off
trains. Most of this then gets loaded onto ships and sent out. It's not being
used here. So give me one good reason why it needs to be located in that
spot? If your argument is strategic infrastructure, there must be a better place
for it than an area at high risk of liquefaction

Because terminal infrastructure needs to be close to existing rail lines? And
there is a shortage of industrial land especially along the waterfront in
Portland that is unused and willing to be sold or dedicated to a different
purpose?

From the Oregon DEQ website: "A LUCS is a form developed by DEQ to determine whether a
DEQ permit or approval will be consistent with local government comprehensive plans and
land use regulations."
have you read the resolution passed by the city council? in it they have enumerated a list of
violations to land use regulations and permit agreements that Zenith has made in the past.
you can read it here:

political choices that harm citizens. this company has had a well-documCenreteadte years long
history of violations of its environmental and land use permits and it makes sense that
Portland residents want it to undergo thorough investigation instead of receiving more
handholding at the cost of citizen and environmental health.

Reading it, it looks like the city council is just repeating activist claims and testimony, or is
holding prejudice against the company because of its past issues complying with state
rules.
The city's job is to enforce city rules, and the claims being made in the resolution that
Zenith is violating city rules are...modified piping transfers? That's just fishing for mistakes
to justify a shutdown, and frankly, just shows that the councilers are politically against the
company.
I would urge you to understand that not everything that seems political is bad
when it is often political choices that harm citizens.
You say as you cite Columbia Riverkeeper, an activist group that tries to stop any and all
development, anywhere, as a reliable or impartial source.

so anyone who challenges this company being granted a permit is misunderstanding
rules and laws but when the company breaks rules and laws it's actually just a little
oopsie on their part and anyone who investigates it should be ignored because they
are a pedantic activist... LOL! I find it comforting to know that in the end humanity and
our resilient planet will prevail over corporate greed and that individuals who strive to
defend corporate wrongdoing now will find themselves fighting on our side in the
future. peace and love to you ✌

That’s not really what a land use compatibility statement (LUCS) is though.
