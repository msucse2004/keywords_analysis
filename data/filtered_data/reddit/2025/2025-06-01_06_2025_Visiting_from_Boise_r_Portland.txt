Visiting from Boise.
Discussion
I DONT EVER WANNA HEAR “Portland is filled with terrible people!” Again!
Went to “Teardrop Lounge” and had a whole conversation about how I did a long run all around downtown and
into Washington Park and how awesome it was.
I’m originally from a bigger city in Texas so was already skeptical about what I was hearing from others.
Besides the fact that everyone was super nice and the city was relatively clean for a big city, I went to pay for my
tab at the bar and it wasn’t working. I tried mutiple cards that 100% had money (I checked.) Luckily it was 33$ and I
had 31$ in cash and I’m 100% certain the bartender paid out of his own pocket to cover the difference. I tried to
tell him multiple times I could figure something else out and he kept saying it was all good.
Seriously besides it being super embarrassing I’m so thankful he did that. Wish I would’ve caught his name. But if
that doesn’t spell out what the people of Portland are like idk what does.
And although the situation was embarrassing I’m so thankful for them figuring it out and helping me out. And I
know it’s only 2$ but I really wanted to tip and cover the whole thing myself. Seriously though, it’s an awesome city
and I would 100% come back.

I moved here from Idaho, lived in Boise for 6 years. Glad you had a good time, this is a cool city!
And yeah, Portland is either a Mecca or a hellhole to Idaho folks, depending on who you’re talking to. It’s
really neither, but it’s a good place.

Mecca for me. Moved here 50 years ago from Idaho Falls and never looked back. And later the rest of my
family followed me.

Honestly I think Portland and Boise are both pretty nice but this seems to be an uncommon opinion.
Portland’s suburbs are infinitely nicer though, I will say that.

Yeah last time I was in Meridian it was just a soulless place devoid of any personality, filled with
manicured lawns that are systematically draining what’s left of the aquifer. And the traffic was way
worse than Tigard or Beaverton. I’ll pass.
I love Boise, though. I lived in the North End for a while and it was so charming and interesting. Also
lived in Parkcenter, which was less interesting but at least it was close to the cool stuff!

Welcome, stranger! It's pretty alright here, just don't tell anyone ;)
If you find your cards not working elsewhere, your bank probably thought out of state transactions were
suspicious and froze them as a safety precaution. Just call them and tell them you're travelling and they'll turn
them back on.

Well--I'm not sure it is fair to say we get "generalized." FOX news spent years talking about how
horrible it was here and showing pictures of the "city-wide" protests and violence. My husband got so
sick of hearing about how dangerous it was for us here from his (Alabama) parents. He finally drove
downtown just to get pictures of the protest (on one block downtown) from the Starbucks, on the
corner, that was open.
Yes, there is a small protest downtown. It is so dangerous you can get a Carmel macchiato and sit on
a Starbucks seat and watch it from across the street.
So..."generalization"--no. Victim of a right-wing-Rupert-Murdoch-funded smear attack to scare the
flatlanders into thinking they must vote opposite of the horrible Oregon Lefties.

As a newer transplant to Portland from SE Idaho… I can confirm this is very true. Idaho is awful.
Awful people (obviously not everyone, but a lot). Awful state. So happy to be away from it. And
the juuuudgement I got from everyone when I said I was moving to Portland was INSANE. I don’t
think I ever met a single person in all my life in Idaho that had a good thing to say about Portland.
They were very clearly oh so wrong. Love this place.

Portland got a really bad national reputation for all the protests and violence during Covid. It was
overblown in the news, though of course it still happened and it was pretty significant. People just
think it’s a lawless chaotic cesspool and forget that it’s a city like any other, and I dare say a better
city than many others.
But yeah, my partner and I moved here from Twin Falls 3 years ago, and when we told people we
were moving to Portland and we were excited about it, the first thing a lot of them said was
“why???”
