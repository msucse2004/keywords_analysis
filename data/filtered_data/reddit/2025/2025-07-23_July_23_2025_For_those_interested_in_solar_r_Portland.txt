Hey all, I just got a 12.42 kw system installed in Portland, Oregon and thought I’d share my experience in case it might be helpful.
👷Finding an installer There are a lot of crummy installers out there with slimy salesman that use shady tactics to get you to sign on. I probably spoke with 6 installers and
only got good vibes from two of them. I highly recommend talking to people who had solar installed in your area, working with local companies, and NOT going with
companies like Ion.
I ended up going with SunPath and had an outstanding experience from start to finish. Another company I really liked was National Solar out of Bend. The only reason I
passed on them was because their panel sizes didn’t quite cover my roof as efficiently.
💸Cost My total out of pocket cost was $30,925. That does not include the 30% tax rebate I’ll receive next year. After that plus the PGE rebate the total cost was ~$20K.
If you don’t need a new roof but are only a few years into the life of yours, I would seriously consider a new roof and factoring that cost into the payback. A roof lasts 30 years
and panels last 30 years, so it’s good to have them in sync.
🌞Panels/inverters 460W REC Alpha Pure RX Enphase IQ8X micro inverters
Don’t go with any installer that doesn’t use Enphase micro inverters. A micro inverter makes each panel operate independently from the array. Without them, if one panel is
shaded, the whole array is impacted.
It sounds like there are a few panel companies that are good, but from my research REC seemed like one of the best, and the installer I liked best used them.
⏰Timeline I was adding a dormer to my house so they couldn’t install until that was framed and roofed but I just kept in touch with them as construction progressed. Once I
had a date we could 100% confirm, they got me on the schedule 2 weeks later. Panels took a day to put up. City inspection happened one week later, and my local utility (PGE)
did the meter swap a week after that and I was officially sending power to the grid.
📊Consumption/Production I use about 7,000 kWh annually. It’s a 1920s home with poor insulation but I don’t blast the central air, and I try to utilize cool air at night to bring
temps down. I also keep the house on the cooler side during the winter. I can’t speak to long term production but this system should produce 173% of my current usage. I
sized up quite a bit because I plan to get an EV and heat pump in the future. And I figure maybe until then I can supplement my gas furnace with electric space heaters and
reduce my gas bill that way.
My system was connected to the grind at 9am on July 23, and I produced 67.7 kWh. The second day, which was technically my first fully day, I got 70.1 kWh. My panels are on
the east and west facing sides of my roof, and my west facing roof does have some trees that block the early morning sun.
🤑Payback A lot of companies will assume crazy electricity price hikes, and they say it’s based on historical data. But just because rates have gone up 10% the last year doesn’t
mean that’ll keep happening. It could! But I think it’s better to look at something like a 30 year average.
I’m assuming 4-5% annual increases, and the companies that felt the most honest also used those figures for their payback period. On that assumption, payback is ~10 years.
But I wanted to bring up something I think a lot of people miss on the finances of solar. I think it’s only fair you compare the cost of the system to investing that cost into the
market — if you have $20k, I think most people would agree that if it’s not being spent it should be in the market growing at ~6%.

If you put $20K into a solar system and that covers your needs (very realistic expectation) you now have what would’ve been your electric bill to put in the market — let’s
Skip to main content
assume $125/month. This doesn't even factor in if you have a heat pump and are getting rid of your gas bill. This is money you can now invest in the maCrrkeeat.te
Assume a 4% annual increase on electricity cost (it's been closer to 10% lately) and in 9 years as long as you're DCAing what would've been your electric bill into the market,
you have $19,962. If you’d invested in the market instead, your $20K investment is now $33,789K. Sounds like the market is still winning -- but wait! If you invested in the
market instead of solar you’ve been paying electricity this whole time. At $125/month plus 4% increases every year that's $15,874. Take that away from your ~$33K and you're
left with $17,915. Solar is winning.
It only gets better from there. At 20 years, your investment in the market is worth $19,475 (after you subtract your electricity cost of $44,667). DCAing your electricity savings in
the same market (6% assumed growth) puts you at $50,770.
In the long run, solar can be very lucrative financially.
🐿Squirrel Guard I see a lot of systems without a squirrel guard, but I decided to go for it. I have squirrels on my roof and didn’t want to take the risk. My installer said one big
benefit is they have to use a concealed rack system, which just means the racking doesn’t stick out past the panels. I’ve seen some systems where the racking sticks out a
couple feet. It doesn’t look bad, but it’s definitely not as clean. I’ll admit the system definitely looked cleaner before the squirrel guard, but I’m hoping it’s worth the protection.
I hope this is helpful for anyone considering solar. So far I’m super happy with the system and it feels great knowing I’m silently generating electricity to cover my needs and
then some.

Thanks for the write up. I have been considering solar for a while and can't really justify it with the cost. Also it seems most solar panels face south, while my house is
east/west facing with skylights taking up a lot of the real estate.

Good post and I had a great experience getting a quote with Sun Path even though I didn’t go for it.
Are you planning on being in your house for 20+ years? I want solar really bad but to me the economics here in Portland with our dark winters (and at my house which
also has an east/west roof) don’t totally make sense.

Yes I do. Based on my calculations though I should break even after ~10 years. We’ll see what electricity rates do though.
I definitely wouldn’t go for it if I didn’t think this was a long term home.

Congrats on going solar! Wild you posted this today, since SunPath just finished installing my 10.12kW system this afternoon! I also got several quotes for my system,
and even though their quote was the for the smallest system overall, they had several opportunities to upsell me and neglected to do so given the setup of my roof when
everyone else was happy to quote impractical/low producing panels just to try to hit 100% energy offset. Also, they were far and away the best to work with out of
everyone I talked to. +1 for the rec!

I have near 10k on my roof from Blue Raven and I absolutely don't recommend them. Their customer service is dreadful, they took almost an entire year to get my panels
on and activated, the entire summer. I engaged them in January, hoping for some summer months, and they turned them on in November, so my first 5 months were
zip...but they had my money in January.

Former residential solar installer in Portland here.
All of this advice is good. Getting 6 bids is correct, ignoring the sales pitch is correct, squirrel guards are indeed necessary, and make sure your system isn't oversized.
But.
In light of the Federal tax credit for residential solar disappearing, it may be best to wait a few years until the state legalized "plug and play" solar like Utah and Germany
have, and install a smaller solar system on your balcony without an installation crew or interconnection agreement. It's so much freaking cheaper even if it won't zero out
your bill.

These market forces and the “Moore’s law” effect keeps mentally from considering any serious capital outlay.
Next gen dictates things get smaller, cheaper, and easier to install, and the technology landscape moves so quickly in this space. This is incidentally why I have
difficulty spending more than $1500 on an ebike.

This is by far the best explanation on solar in portland. Every year I run the math and it never adds up for me. My break even point is around 12 years for size of roof and
usage. But with the way the rate hikes are going, it might be a faster break even point.
Once I need a new roof, the next thing going on it is solar.

ROI is dependent on how what you pay for solar, available incentives, location in Oregon, shading, orientation, equipment, and utility company. National Solar was
offering REC Alpha Pure-RX 470 watt panels at around $2.38 per watt. The Energy Trust of Oregon incentive is increasing to $2,500 for PGE customers in 2026. How
long has SunPath been in business? A&R is also recommended.

That's why we have met metering & systems are installed based on estimated annual production....
With 20 panels I still generate more than I use during the annual cycle. System size was calculated & installed before I changed my old heat pump to a much
more efficient system... which is why I end up with a good size donation at the end of the cycle.....

Do you have net metering with PGE? If so, my understanding is that any credits you have saved at the end of the winter are taken away from you. So there’s not much of
an advantage to overproduction.

It's Oregon law not PGE that is giving the unused credits to low income power customers.

Right. At the end of March any extra credits get donated to low income households. It’s definitely not financially advantageous to overproduce — but I plan to grow
into it in the next few years by switching to electric heat and likely getting an EV in the future. I figure I can also use some space heaters to decrease my natural gas
bill some in the winter in the meantime.

Our Ion rep told us we could include our roof cost in the 30% solar tax credit which is absolutely not true. We did the research on that early and that became our
"how honest is this outfit?" question. Their prices were also much higher for less and they really want to get you on a payment plan.

They just had slimy sales tactics and were way more expensive. Also, at least from who I spoke with, they didn’t use micro inverters. What was your cost per watt

From my experience it was worse equipment, higher prices, and deceiving info.
That being said, I’m glad you had a good experience! You have more experience with them than me and it’s good to hear your install worked out.

Another happy sunpather chiming in, in Hillsboro south facing and west facing 42 panels and just hit 1 year of power. Our setup should do about 102% of annual when
all said and done.
Most of the proper local companies are good.. ion/blue raven/freedom forever are terrible and so is their solar lease terms..
Based on sunpath calcs, we’re a 6-year break even. Although we enjoy the 315 dollar smaller power bills in summer. Our last bill before the net metering was 335, now
we’re paying 16 dollars unless we don’t have enough banked in the winter like late last year.
For Oregon the first year will be not full net zero or even the full savings.. June or early July is best time to soak in the net metering daylight.

One thing to keep in mind. Sometimes the solar companies will try and short you on the micro inverters. What I mean is I got 400w panels but micro inverters that were
only good for 300w. So they sold me a system that could only actually give me 75% of what they told me it would.
7 Reply
brrent OP•4mo ago
Your panels will likely never actually hit 400W though. From my understanding, it’s actually ideal to slightly undersized the micro inverters. My panels are 460 and my
inverters are 384. Not quite as much of a difference as yours, but I don’t think you’re getting as short changed as you think.

Thought about going with solar but our roof framing is old and the city wanted us to pay for an engineer to evaluate it. Our roof also isn't south facing and I didn't want
to spend the extra money on having to compensate with extra panels.

Yeah I think SunPath had an engineer out as part of the project to make sure my house was structurally viable. It was $1000 or so. I could be wrong, but I think in
most instances all you’d really need is to sister the rafters. Mine were already sistered for some reason on the front dormer, and the back dormer was new and built to
modern code so didn’t need an inspection.
And thank you! I’m actually really liking the look of the panels on the front of the house — just a clean grid covering the dormer roof.

The hard part in Portland is permitting. The city is notoriously strict with load calcs for solar installs. Unless you have a recent manufactured truss roof, you are likely
going to have to hire an engineer and pay for the rafters to be reinforced because most older Portland construction will be over-spanned.
I agree that almost any electrician can install solar panels once the paperwork is taken care of.

SarisweetieD •4mo ago
Many of the solar companies do the engineering in-house, and the solar permit process was streamlined in Portland a year or two ago, so with the stamped
engineering calcs (unless it’s ballasted or the panels and racking are over 4.5lbs/sf), it’s a very simple permit with no structural review.

Yeah I didn’t look much into financing but I’ve heard they can be usurious, especially now with rates where they are.
Portland definitely isn’t a bad place for solar though. Sure, there are sunnier places. But we have super long summer days and it’s sunny for all of them.
You also have to consider how the local utility handles it, and PGE makes it appetizing by giving you 1:1 kWh credits.
Maybe it’s not for everyone, but it’s a fact that there’s enough sun to cover a household’s needs and it pays back in a reasonable timeframe.

No, you can only do that if you have a battery. It sounds weird at first, but it’s a safety mechanism for people working on the power lines. If the power is out you can’t
be sending power through the lines while people are working on them. Agreed though — it would be cool if they could figure that out.

Does your system actually power your house, or does it just go straight into the utility line and back to the power company?
This is my one issue with solar right now is that the majority of installs I see, have zero capability of actually powering the home, which seems to be an important aspect
of having your own ability to generate electricity.
I'm always curious on everyone's setups.

I wouldn't say *only* consider systems with microinverters... they are considered a premium product but it's a bit of an oversimplification that if one panel gets shaded
with a central inverter you lose efficiency across the whole array. All of the competing products I looked at at least let me split the roof into a coupleC rseeaptaerate zones, even
if every panel wasn't totally independent. So if one panel got shaded, you might lose some efficiency across like 1/4 of your system but the other 3/4 wouldn't be
affected at all. That said, I got Enphase anyway for the longer warranties and because I wanted to avoid Tesla.
