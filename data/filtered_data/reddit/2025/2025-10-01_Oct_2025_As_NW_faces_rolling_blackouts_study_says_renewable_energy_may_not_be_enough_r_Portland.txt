Why should they pay as much as residential consumers per kilowatt hour when they require far
less infrastructure per kilowatt hour? They don't have overhead lines in their neighborhood that
require free trimming, they don't require call centers to understand their bill, they don't need all
that distribution infrastructure tanks staff to maintain it.
Industrial uses always have had a lower electric bill per kilowatt hour than residential.

Tyler had some good ideas
Datacenters are a bit different than your typical industrial user. Their scale is so large that they
do need additional infrastructure. That's fine, as long as they're paying for it.
If tree trimming is what drives PGEs sustained rate increases that's one thing but it's more
about climate goal spending in my understanding.

Yeah as a transmission planner, the closest thing to this that I remember was a potential resource
inadequacy during I think a 2031 or 2032 Winter scenario where California was asking if the PNW could
increase imports (edit: increase exports to California).
I definitely don't think the article title matches reality.

installed, have plenty of good uses.
Put another way: if the compute isn't useful at the DC (for AI or otherwise), why would the

Even outdated GPUs still get used. They aren't used for training the latest models, but
they are still good for validating models and preparing data for training (assuming the

The only time I've seen a GPU node get pulled is when the hardware fails and it is too
old to buy replacement parts (which is about 7 years on average).

The article doesn't discuss this until near the end, and then only briefly, but a lot of this is the fault of the
Bonneville Power Administration. They're mostly in charge of transmission in the PNW, and while I know they
have constraints, so far as I can tell, they've completely failed in their mandate.
Among other things, they've made the interconnection cues incredibly long and uncertain, drastically
reducing how much new power can come on line.
They've instituted some reforms, and I guess it's better now...? Still, it's their completely foreseeable and
foreseen slow-motion disaster. Tho I guess it's everyone else's too, since they weren't given the financial
support needed to actually build out and modernize transmission in ways that would've at least helped...
They mention the main supply-demand mismatch time as cold mornings, so if you're wondering what you
can do, installing insulating curtains on your windows makes a surprisingly large difference.

Yes, it's the current policy in Oregon; however, I don't think we've had any polling regarding new
nuclear construction conducted recently in our state. I would not be surprised if the public opinion
has shifted over the decades on this subject.
The problem for nuclear development (as an industry) is that people immediately freak out by
remembering Chernobyl or Fukushima (or even Three Mile Island if they are old/educated enough).
But nuclear power plants can be built safely, and it can be a great intermediate solution while we
move away from the fossil fuels.
Most people don't get the irony of being anti-nuclear power development while at the same time
complaining about climate change.

You understand that the cost of building one would be passed on to consumers through the electric bill
and would raise electricity costs after it starts producing? The price we pay for electricity is from a
bidding process. Solar and wind bid at pennies while nuclear has to bid at hundreds of dollars per unit.
They would also impact fish, especially salmon, from the heated water they return back to the water

Nuclear is not a demand power source. It is a baseline power source because they operate at a
continuous power output.
Solar and wind are also not a demand source because we can't control their source. However, we
can deploy storage systems on the grid to provide for demand changes and interpretation of the
sun or wind.
Solar is ridiculously cheap now days and wind isn't that expensive. Storage tech is the highest
cost, but technology will evolve and bring down that cost. The biggest miss by not expanding
solar/wind/storage is the job opportunities.
I don't think you understand the costs of any of these systems if you think nuclear will be cheap
for consumers at any term of time.

I’ve lived in NoVa don’t really think that’s a fair comparison. Northern Virginia’s grid is

For one, a very large part of their grid was built with defense funding.
But even then, my understanding (and please correct me if I’m wrong) is that it’s much
easier to add more capacity to transmission lines that already exist. NoVA is densely
populated, with lots of infrastructure already in place. Oregon? Not so much.

Burying the lede a little bit:
But Olsen said those rolling blackouts would happen only on very rare and extreme occasions, like the
January 2024 ice storm that left tens of thousands without power. The risk is higher when extreme
weather conditions happen at the same time as power generation is reduced due to low hydropower
output from the Columbia River and with low wind and solar production.
That's how it always is. Extreme weather conditions create instability.

If you really want to mitigate a potentially unreliable grid, you gotta get a battery along with your solar. If
you do panels only, you're actually mildly contributing to rising costs for your neighbors, because
Oregon's 1:1 net metering is a generous subsidy for residential solar which makes it a stealth tax on
everyone else. This is why California doesn't have 1:1 net metering anymore.
The problem with Oregon's policy is the strongest ROI for a homeowner currently is to get solar but not
batteries, which isn't nearly as systemically beneficial.
With a battery you can export clean electricity during demand peaks, not just when sunlight peaks. That's
what actually stabilizes our grid and helps your neighbors, and PGE pays you (in dollars, not kWh credits)
for it.

Using eminent domain to build transmission lines is not the type of "new deal" infrastructure people

The electric grid affects everybody. Everybody will have to pay in for the new infrastructure.

So why haven’t they paid for any of it so far?
They’re given carve outs and subsidies to “attract business and generate jobs.”
Again, go gargle Sam Altman’s balls. Maybe if you do, he’ll pay your electric bill

I think its very telling that the majority of people here are looking for who they should punish, data centers,
CEOs, utilities, etc instead of looking for solutions to our problems, ie build more clean energy and
transmission lines, and streamline the permitting process for clean energy.

They're more obsessed with settling scores than actually solving a problem.

Good, maybe if we can't power our phones it'll get us all off this stupid app and make us talk to each other irl.

Bitching about the internet while on the internet is certainly an interesting take.

Guy who thinks rolling blackouts are good because at least we're talking to each other when we're
looting stores for food.

You are correct that these are bad but also they have rolling blackouts in California and nobody is
looting stores there (yet)

Are you referring to 2001's energy crisis? That was a quarter century ago .

These reports echo what independent contractors, utility watchdogs, and the DOE under both Democratic
and Republican administrations have all said.
If you're trying to say these threats of blackouts are a utility conspiracy, you're not listening to what
literally anybody in the utility space, including regulators, have been saying.

No, specifically I am not listening to a hack hired by industry shills.
Yes, there is a lot we need to do.
But garbage like this isn't how we get to where that needs to be.

All of this is solvable.
Batteries are getting better
Solar / wind is getting more plentiful
Data Centers or other industrial uses can pause operations during extreme weather events
Certainly we need more transmission lines and more installs (rooftop and industrial scale). But this article
feels doomier and gloomier than need be.

Batteries do not work well in extremely cold temperatures, which is when these projected outages are to
occur.
