Here’s what I’m not sure the DSA City Councilors understand
Discussion
The people of Portland have spent the last 15ish years passing bond measures and supporting/funding every
conceivable method to provide services to the street and houseless population of Portland; in a desperate effort to
return our communities to clean, drug free(ish) and safe environments. For a variety of reasons that aren’t
important to this post, nothing has worked and the situation just keeps getting worse.
What I think the DSA folks don’t understand is that a lot of us are exhausted with the experiments. We’re
exhausted and financially tapped out funding every new idea that never works, and left wondering where all the
money went. What we really want, even if it’s temporary, is to have clean, safe, drug free streets again. That’s it. I
voted for Mayor Wilson because he convinced me that he would do that in the most reasonable, humane and
yes…. Cost effective manner possible. I’m sorry, but after 15 years of watching what was nationally known as an
amazing place to live, turn into a very expensive (taxed out the yazoo) toilet, I’m done with experiments. At least
for now. I’d like to see a downtown core thriving with small, medium and large businesses. I’d like to see clean
streets filled with people on business trips, vacations and locals just enjoying the city. DSA City Councilors, I need
you to understand where I’m coming from. It’s not that I’m unwilling to try new methods. But I’m not supporting
any new taxes to that end, and I need to see results. Now. Not in some optimistic future.

The individuals perceived as making shelters unsafe are often the same individuals perceived as making
public spaces unwelcoming.

Exactly. All the challenges, hazards, risks people cite about shelters are even bigger challenges, hazards,
and risks for ungoverned, lawless encampments. It’s hard to run a shelter when people don’t want to
follow any rules. It’s even harder to live in a neighborhood blighted with campers who don’t want to
follow any rules.

While I don’t entirely disagree with your point, it does seem important to keep in mind that a huge
percentage of the folks in question are dealing with mental health issues. More often than not, it is
now “people don’t want to follow any rules” as much as “We are the richest nation in the history of
the planet and yet we choose to ignore, incarnate, or kill people who have the misfortune to be both
mentally ill and poor”.

Leaving people with mental health problems to fend for themselves in lawless street
encampments is not good for anyone, certainly not for the people themselves.

I absolutely agree. I’m not pro-encampment, I just think it is very easy to start viewing folks as
a problem rather than victims of a failed social system. It doesn’t change the need to clean up
the streets and take a more proactive approach, but it should impact the way that is done.

I would argue that your claim only works if you revise it to “The vast majority of
mentally ill folks with a stable social and financial support structure are not behaving
like this.” My severely mentally ill family member is safe and non-violent because her
family has had the ability and willingness to spend tens of thousands of dollars on
treatment programs. For someone with severe mental illness who can’t hold a job and
therefore doesn’t have insurance, it is almost impossible to manage their condition. I
agree that it doesn’t help to view people as victims without any agency, but all too
often the option to “keep people accountable” is to throw them in jail with no mental

Some people are indeed a problem. There are real-life examples of individuals from
privileged backgrounds making poor life choices, leading to addiction and homelessness.
However, not everyone experiencing addiction or mental illness on the streets was failed
by the social system. There needs to be some individual accountability for those who
choose such a lifestyle, which is unfortunately quite prevalent.

Society has certainly failed those with severe mental illness. This must be changed.
However, individual rights also come with responsibilities. Actions by those who are
unable or unwilling to engage in social responsibility must be subject to social
consequence. That's simply how society works.

I think the failure is with Multnomah County and their shitty handling of the services- even while the have the
VAST majority of the resources to address the problem. This quite frankly shouldn’t even be on the city’s
books, we need to consolidate the County and City NOW and be more proactive about services that work,
not paying 292 different non profits to do that work with zero accountability (like the county does). Sweeps
are only a last resort because the county is failing so badly.

I ranked some DSA members high, and broadly agree with them on many topics. But this IRP reduction is
missing the mark, and worse, I fear it's poisoning the well toward progressive stances in general.
It's not enough to have new, radical, or bold ideas. It's not enough to state "sweeps are inhumane" and look
at the world through that lens. You have to market your ideas, build consensus, and show results. You have to
hear and acknowledge people's valid concerns. Show that you have a plan, show where your actions fit into
that plan. Do the hard work to empathize with both the people in the camps and the people affected by
camping.
I just don't see any of that happening right now.

There is no "quick fix solution" to deeply rooted systemic issues that have been escalating for years. We need
to just take the bandaid off already and build proper PUBLIC run (not "non-profit" run) social programs.
For example, 22% of homeless people have severe mental illness and 50% of homeless people have some
mental or physical disability. These are people who the federal government has just abandoned by making
SSDI benefits way too low to afford basic living conditions and making the regulations around it way too
stringent.

Who do you think provides mental health services? It’s not the county—it’s Cascadia, a nonprofit.
Everyone who works in nonprofit social services would love to have a proper public sector job. But
governments don’t want to do that because they would have to pay living wages.

The county does provide some mental health services in mult co— civil commitment investigators

EASA, it’s not all non profits — much of the services are, But not all — edit to add: they contracted
with non profits to save money. Cascadia pay is super low compared with the county and PERS and
benefits. If it were provided by the county it would cost a lot more and potentially not be any better…
but it might be better if people are willing to pay for it

I don't know that forced relocation (i.e. sweeps) are the best possible solution, but in the ideal
situation these are paired with connection to services. How often does that occur in Portland? I
don't think that data is available, but hopefully it's the goal each time. There is a lot of nuance
that is lost, both in the taglines rattled off by our city council and in the discussion on this forum.

I have love in Portland (mostly SE) for almost 20 years. Yes that makes me a transplant (from Texas/in2008).
The first 10 years were great, I was relatively young so that meant renting, and at that time it was reasonable,
especially when considering that at that time other costs of living were still largely reasonable. The better part
of the last 10 years has been devastating. Spent nearly 7 years homeless/in shelter (I'll get to the problems
with shelters in a moment) and during the pandemic I was one of those evil, disgusting people housed in a
trailer on the side of the road.
First of all, I won't pretend that at this point in my life I have never battled addiction, or that I don't now suffer
from extensive mental health issues. What is important to know here is, initially, my only issues were:
undiagnosed autism/adhd, being somewhat poor to begin with (I had never been lucky enough to experience
not living paycheck to paycheck, even in childhood), I didn't come from a family that was capable of "helping
out" (financially or otherwise), and I couldn't afford to go to college (and wasn't enough of a minority/ didn't
have the appearance of someone who deserved subsidies/grants/scholarships).
I can appreciate that all of you (I'm primarily referring to homeowners) have problems that, if nothing else,
matter to you, and that I cannot fathom or fully understand having never had the privilege or pleasure of
seeing from your perspective. This is, by nature, a two way street.
So understand that what I say here is not to dismiss, invalidate, or even argue with the reality that is there are
problems on every side of this issue, and that none of us are actually able to see all aspects (as we all are
incapable of being an outside perspective).
All of that to say: It is also mind-blowing to me, that with the insane amount of money they claim to use on,
strictly, homeless-services there is little result to be shown.
Someone earlier in this thread commented that they believe non-profits to be at the center of the issue, and I
think I partially agree, though not necessarily for the same reasons(admittedly not necessarily for different
reasons either, I'm just trying to not align fully with any perspective that I've read in this thread because, all
that I read I found I disagreed in part or fully with). The reasons I believe that non-profits are a(fairly large)
part of the problem are numerous so I'm going to try to keep it condensed as much as I am able.
Non-profits: Since the majority of my time spent in shelters were as a family unit (my daughter, myself, and
my ex-husband) I can primarily speak to issues within the "family style" shelter experience. Most of you

probably remember in the pandemic what it was like to be, shall we say, stacked on top of each other within
Skip to main content
your home. Now imagine that is every single day of your life. On top of that things like, Csroemateetimes daily,
room checks where I was once chastised for having brought an additional shelf (small plastic Rubbermaid
style) into the room so that I could store our dry foods goods more efficiently and effectively and in a more
organized fashion, thus making it possible to make our monthly food stamp benefit actually last a month.
One key issue that I cannot say enough times or stress to you enough is, not one family style shelter, and I
have seen and lived in them all due to time limits and things of that nature, not one has cooking facilities that
are realistic or in some cases even allows you to cook with anything other than a microwave. Before
experiencing shelter life I didn't have a microwave, I don't like them I understand that technically they're safe,
but I think we can agree at least most of us can agree that they do not end in what most would call an
enjoyable culinary experience. So, with the exception of a few less micromanaging facilities, feeding my family
for an entire month while using only our food stamp benefits to pay for food, meant either eating nothing
but Hot pockets and tostino's pizzas cooked in a microwave.
It is exceedingly rare, however they do technically exist, but some facilities would provide what they called
meals to all of their... let's call them, residents. In every case they do not provide all meals, and in every case in
which I experienced, they do not take into consideration dietary restrictions, allergens/allergies etc. Now, to
their credit, a couple did provide reasonably effective meals, typically once a day, and they did so I'm very
slim budgets. I will say, I believe that the workers (the ones actually at the facilities everyday dealing with
problems and people ect.) likely did what they felt was their best with little support if any at all from upper
management who ultimately made all of the decisions and largely based on my observations profited from
the funds being distributed to them.
Now I know, there's going to be a bunch of people saying "but hey they're non-profits..." . I agree with you,
they aren't nonprofits, so why is the obvious and clear misuse of funding so rampant? That is a question that
plagued me every moment of every day spent within those facilities. Ultimately a lot of you aren't wrong,
something is going on, someone is lying, where is this money going? This is the question on the lips of every
person in these facilities. So if nothing else, let this be our common ground. I may not have a voice that
people will listen to, but you all do. Let us work together to end this horrible travesty of a situation that,
you're right, didn't used to exist like this. I assure you, the greater majority of the surge of people into this
situation, do not want to be in it. Like someone else earlier in this thread said, it's a short road to addiction,
crime, and mental health issues the moment you hit the streets. Even if your life previously was arguably well-
managed or that nuances involved in your particular situation were largely out of your hands, that road is
short.
When you have no options, no one listens to you, no one to turn to for help or guidance, what do you do?
What would you do? I can tell you right now so many of you are thinking to yourselves oh well I'd do blah
blah blah... What you don't understand is that I was like that once, most of the currently houseless population
was like that once. The fact is once you land in this situation you are immediately seen as incapable, drug
addicted, unworthy of making decisions that fit your own life and thus meeting of someone to do it for you.
So when I ask what would you do, you must put yourself in the perspective of someone with these problems.
You can't offer advice as though you were yourself in your own situations currently, but one of a broken
unworthy incapable criminal menace to society. When you can look from that perspective, then you can offer
helpful effective advice. Not until then.
As much as I cannot understand all of your problems, the ways in which you are affected by your atmosphere
and those around you, you cannot understand mine. Believe me, I wish that you could. I'm not revealing
these devastating embarrassing parts of my life so that you can laugh at me, or to make myself an example of

These programs do nothing to address the underlying issues that put homeless people on the streets in the
first place. In this country, we do almost nothing to rehabilitate and integrate homeless people. Sure, we've
given them a lot of stuff and shitty spaces to be in and cooling stations or water stations and more lenient
camping laws, but none of this addresses a need for counseling, mental health treatment, job placement,
affordable housing, drug treatment, basic understanding of finances, and support groups.
There are examples of this working across Europe with much higher success rates than what we have here.
We have so much empty real estate that we can use for this at very low cost. We have programs right now
that are underfunded and do exactly the thing that I am proposing and are working, but see almost no
funding because we'd rather throw money down the drain.
Did I mention these programs are cheaper long term as well?
The DSA is going about this all wrong. We need to sell better programs and use more of what we have. We
do not need to cut and run like we have for decades.

families and doesn’t glorify people who in a lot of instances are on the streets because they choose to be
there. Anyone could walk into Unity right now and get detox treatment and connected with services. But
they don’t. Services that support families means not having sh*t and needles all over the place. That’s just
a basic thing a city should be able to do. I’d love to see more support for basics but if businesses keep
closing or moving the city’s tax base will shrink more and more. They need to stop wasting money on

Today was an example of who are the serious people on Portland City Council, and who are not. "The
problem is the system" people are not serious and need to be aggressively opposed next election.
Morillo's amendment was classic "truthiness" on display - it didn't matter that it had no chance in getting
people off the street, it just mattered that she wanted to end human suffering, so anyone opposed to her
must be pro-human suffering. Ugh.
For too long Portland has been the place where imperfect but meaningfully impactful measures to
combat the homelessness crisis have gone to die, all so councilors and commissioners can pursue perfect
"solutions" that "feel right" but have no chance of succeeding. The end result is that people aren't getting
off the streets; instead homelessness, waste, open air drug use, and the decline of our public places got
worse.
I'm tired of our government and elected leaders letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. I'm glad
Wilson's efforts are showing results. And I think the entire slate of DSA councilors need to be voted out of
office and replaced by people who want to make progress, rather than seek perfection.

I'm surprised to hear you think the houseless population is causing a downturn in tourism. I recently visited as
a tourist, expecting it to be beyond anything I’ve ever seen based on what I'd seen on this sub, and I don’t say
this to trivialize your experience. However, it was really quite tame compared to other cities I’ve visited as a
tourist, and it still hasn't detracted me from visiting those cities. Maybe I am just more used to it because I
travel a lot, and the housing crisis is getting extreme in most American cities.
I am in Florida and surrounded by conservatives. 10/10 don’t want to go to Portland because they think the
“antifa BLM riots” of 2020 are still going on. No one ever mentions houseless folks.

instance? Nothing seemed even to come close. Also, the houseless people in FL are much more
aggressive and will follow you, yell at you, and corner you against buildings. I didn’t experience any of
that in Portland. I did see a few people using drugs and some small camps, but they rarely even
looked my way or acknowledged my existence.

LMAO whut? Are you confusing the Mission with Tenderloin? I visit SF a lot because I have family
living there, and while there are parts of Mission that are ... extra... quite a lot of Mission is
completely normal. And the parts that have drug use, that I've seen, are on par with Portland.
Tenderloin, however, is a completely different situation... just all kinds of human misery. That
being said, I think it's f-ed up that people can just literally rot on the streets, anywhere.

I wonder if the perspective you’re lacking is that the reason the City looks and feels better right now is
because of the efforts of Mayor Wilson. The same Mayor and efforts several of the City Councilors are
fighting tooth and nail against.

So, Wilson is doing more sweeps per month than Wheeler did at the end of his term, but it's like
600 vs 700 per month, not a night and day difference. Wilson has also built out congregate
shelters, but ~1000 beds doesn't offset the increase in the number of people who have become
homeless in the past several years.
Wilson's policies are not markedly different than Wheeler's and they both use the same "I'm a
compassionate liberal, but..." messaging, too.

downtown and spent most of our time there, SE, the Pearl, and Washington Park area for 8 nights.

I used to live downtown and still go there often. It has improved immensely the past couple of
years. It was pretty dysfunctional between 2020-2022 and a lot of the businesses left (imo due to
Covid). While it has improved greatly, office vacancies are still a lot lower than they were pre
pandemic, which has led to a decrease in the revenues we use to fund services. That is an
outstanding problem for me, how do we continue to fund services at the rate we do or expand
them without those revenues? Portland and Oregon doesn’t have the sheer number of
millionaires and billionaires that NY and Florida due. There are wealthy people, but I think a lot of
people here think they’re wealthier than they are.

This makes sense to me as well. Commercial real estate is struggling across the nation, which
has never fully recovered. You're right, there is a significant financial impact related to that. I
don't know what the solution is, because many companies seized the opportunity to save on
overhead, which is not a bad thing. It does mean we have to become strategic about how we
recoup that loss and how we use those spaces. I mean this very generally and not just in
reference to DT Portland.
Your point is well taken on the wealth differences, too. Unfortunately, no one here seems
willing to use that wealth to help people, make the streets safe for pedestrians, ensure
healthcare is available, or provide books in libraries for children.

It is 100% affecting the housing and lodgings tax, which directly funds the venues run through those
taxes (lower each year than budgets accounted for five, three, and one year ago) It is definitely causing
lost tourism through conventions, traveling exhibitions/performances, etc. which directly leads to budget
holes in things like the Schnitz, the Expo, OCC, etc. It’s not just homelessness, it’s the Trump sparked
shitstorm of bad press and the cycle of bad news again and again.

Okay, THAT makes sense. I can absolutely see how lacking funding for events like that would affect it.
Orlando goes out of its way to attract large conventions, et al. even though the theme parks are
drawing in massive revenue and people traveling here.
In general the PR around Portland has been mind boggling insane to me. I see clearly the housing
crisis is truly Portland’s #1 issue but imo it seems like y’all are much closer than most major cities to
really helping these people. I hope the city can find peace about this because it really is sad to see
how divisive it is for the community.

I used to be a member of the Portland DSA, but I left around the time of the last election because I felt the
group was turning into an echo chamber. It’s like it became a contest on who could create the most
progressive ideology with no regard for how that ideology would play here. I still generally agree with their
long-term ideologies, but we live in a mid sized city during a recession. We have to be realistic too.
What’s frustrated me the most about the DSA members on the council is that they immediately made it Us vs
Them vs the more “centrist” councilors. The DSA members almost always vote as a bloc and they do a terrible
job working together with non-DSA members. They are all leftists- it shouldn’t be this hard to get along! It’s
like they crave conflict when Portlanders just want our city officials to band together. 95% of the conflict
comes from DSA doing dumb shit like the children’s levy fiasco.
I actually think it would be generally ok if there were only 2 or 3 DSA members (like Kanal or Dunphy, not
Morillo). With six of them, I think they feel under pressure to do some grand progressive gestures to show
that they are fighting the good fight.
Anyway, I hope people remember who voted what on this amendment when the next election comes around.
I certainly won’t forget.

I think "nothing has worked" is a bit of an exaggeration. I think we can all point to things that have gotten
markedly better in the past few years. How much of this is due to policy or just a correction from the epic
levels of shittiness of 2020-22, I don't know, but I know I want the city to stay the course.
The DSA councilors are... not rooted in reality. Probably flying high off the NYC mayoral win, but I think they
seriously overestimate 2025 Portland's willingness to go along with "We need to end all human suffering
before we can pick up the garbage" approaches.

The thing that you have in common with the DSA counselors is that you’re not certain on how to solve this
problem. The causes are numerous. The cost of housing is off the charts everywhere. For years connected
developers were given free rein over housing in this city, and affordable housing was destroyed and never
replaced. I’ve lived in this city for 30 years. I’ve worked in construction and development. I’ve been a project
manager, a portfolio manager, and owned a consulting company. I’ve been dealing with these issues for the
bulk of my professional life, and can say with 100% confidence that the DSA people have a much better idea
of how to find creative solutions to these problems than Keith Wilson does. I like the mayor, he gives a shit,
and he disagrees with OP in one very key aspect. He doesn’t think this city is a toilet. Anyone who uses that

They all signed on to that DSA "tenant bill of rights," which if implemented in full would tank housing

schools and libraries, it’s about providing services to working class citizens and getting the

This is all right but also this is a state with no sales tax and a defanged property tax that the median
Portlander is only paying like 45% of what they should be based on their property's real market value. So it
makes sense to me that even with all the nickel-and-dime taxes and fees, we're falling behind on government
revenue.

The pending property tax cliff isn’t with homeowners, it’s with reassessed commercial property that’s

You’re leaving income tax out of your analysis. Oregon has an eye wateringly high (and surprisingly flat)

With the high earners taxes on top of this, Portland is consistently cited as one of the heaviest tax burden

The mean residential AV in multco is 49% of RMV. That says nothing about what the nominal tax RATE (or
outlay) is. Mean nominal RATE is 1.025%. That’s already above the mean and well above the median for
the 30 largest cities in the US. If you’re suggesting we should be paying 2.050%, that would be the
highest in that group by a country mile.
Homeowners pay plenty of property taxes as a bloc in Portland. The distribution amongst members of the
bloc may not be the fairest, but the tax taken as a whole is in no way ‘defanged’. Plenty of cities our size
or larger do more, often with less.

Inclusionary zoning shoulders some of the blame by reducing the new housing being built on lots to just
those that have 19 units. Restrictions on redevelopment, historical designations on 60 year single family home
old neighborhoods, long permitting processes, etc. all reduce the ability of developers in the city to build
"middle housing" https://rpa.org/work/reports/how-six-cities-are-creating-missing-middle-housing
essentially restricting most new housing to a very small fraction of the total land that's zoned residential or
mixed-use. These restrictions all significantly boost the cost of housing. Because city government is horrible
at cost-effectively building housing (4x higher on average for the same unit versus built by the private sector),
it's crucial that City Government focus on reducing the obstacles that zoning, covenants, permitting process,
etc. that cause worthwhile projects to fail to financially pencil out.
Part of the homelessness problem is due to high rent cost for apartments. Back in the 1990 when rents were
low for all of us ($1116-$1240/month for a one bedroom in today's dollars, adjusted for inflation), many
rented places that were bigger than needed, with a spare room or spare corner of a room. So when a relative
or friend fell on hard times, or a mother and kids suddenly needed a place to couch surf space was available
somewhere. For every $100 increase in rent, homelessness increases by roughly 10%. Now that average rent
for a one bedroom is $1800/month, that pushes out those couch surfers and causes many more to be one
paycheck missed away from losing their housing. So doing the math ($1800-$1240 = $560) giving us an
increase in homelessness of 56% more than what we would've seen. That's more than half of the problem!
By lowering the cost of housing, the city could save a significant amount on what it spent in 2024 for
homelessness mitigation efforts! (A 2024 fiscal year report found that the Portland area spent over $724
million on homelessness services)
I want to be clear, I'm not suggesting using tax payer money to subsidize housing. I want the city government
to enable and encourage the private sector to build more housing. Then whatever the city saves of that $724
million, they can provide to those that are easy to re-house such as veterans, people with disabilities, mothers
with young children by paying them the difference between 30% of their government benefits and the cost of
market rent housing adequate for the number of people living there. (The average annual veterans pension is
$14,486. 30% x $14,486 = $4,345/year or $362/month for housing. So the city could provide them with
$1,437/month to make up for the difference, ensuring that they are only paying 30% of their total benefit. If
all of the homeless people in the Portland area were retired veterans, this scheme could cover over half a
million people with that $724 million/year, easily eliminating the problem. This is certainly not the whole
answer to the problem, but it's instructive to see just how much of the current problem can be solved by
taking a different approach. I'm eager to hear what other ideas you all have!

I agree. I voted for the supportive housing tax because I wanted to see people moved off the street and into
some kind of appropriate shelter—that didn't happen despite what I pay to the county every year. I voted for

to all is my #1 local issue and I'm tired of paying for it with no results.
