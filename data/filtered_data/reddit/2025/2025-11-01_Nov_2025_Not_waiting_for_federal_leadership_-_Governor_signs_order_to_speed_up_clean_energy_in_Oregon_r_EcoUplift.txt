Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday signed an executive order directing Oregon agencies to accelerate the state's clean
energy transition and cut emissions.
Oregon has some of the nation's most ambitious climate laws, and this new order builds on that record.
Executive order 25-29 will reduce emissions and make building clean energy projects faster and more efficient to
"deliver more affordable energy for communities across our state," Kotek said in a statement.
"We're not waiting for federal leadership; Oregon is leading the way," Nora Apter, Oregon Director for Climate
Solutions said in a statement.
